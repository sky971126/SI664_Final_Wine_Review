Kerin O’Keefe,Nicosia 2013 Vulkà Bianco  (Etna),"Aromas include tropical fruit, broom, brimstone and dried herb. The palate isn't overly expressive, offering unripened apple, citrus and dried sage alongside brisk acidity.",87
Roger Voss,Quinta dos Avidagos 2011 Avidagos Red (Douro),"This is ripe and fruity, a wine that is smooth while still structured. Firm tannins are filled out with juicy red berry fruits and freshened with acidity. It's  already drinkable, although it will certainly be better from 2016.",87
Paul Gregutt,Rainstorm 2013 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"Tart and snappy, the flavors of lime flesh and rind dominate. Some green pineapple pokes through, with crisp acidity underscoring the flavors. The wine was all stainless-steel fermented.",87
Alexander Peartree,St. Julian 2013 Reserve Late Harvest Riesling (Lake Michigan Shore),"Pineapple rind, lemon pith and orange blossom start off the aromas. The palate is a bit more opulent, with notes of honey-drizzled guava and mango giving way to a slightly astringent, semidry finish.",87
Paul Gregutt,Sweet Cheeks 2012 Vintner's Reserve Wild Child Block Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Much like the regular bottling from 2012, this comes across as rather rough and tannic, with rustic, earthy, herbal characteristics. Nonetheless, if you think of it as a pleasantly unfussy country wine, it's a good companion to a hearty winter stew.",87
Michael Schachner,Tandem 2011 Ars In Vitro Tempranillo-Merlot (Navarra),"Blackberry and raspberry aromas show a typical Navarran whiff of green herbs and, in this case, horseradish. In the mouth, this is fairly full bodied, with tomatoey acidity. Spicy, herbal flavors complement dark plum fruit, while the finish is fresh but grabby.",87
Kerin O’Keefe,Terre di Giurfo 2013 Belsito Frappato (Vittoria),"Here's a bright, informal red that opens with aromas of candied berry, white pepper and savory herb that carry over to the palate. It's balanced with fresh acidity and soft tannins.",87
Roger Voss,Trimbach 2012 Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"This dry and restrained wine offers spice in profusion. Balanced with acidity and a firm texture, it's very much for food.",87
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Heinz Eifel 2013 Shine Gewürztraminer (Rheinhessen),"Savory dried thyme notes accent sunnier flavors of preserved peach in this brisk, off-dry wine. It's fruity and fresh, with an elegant, sprightly footprint.",87

Roger Voss,Leon Beyer 2012 Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"This is a dry wine, very spicy, with a tight, taut texture and strongly mineral character layered with citrus as well as pepper. It's a food wine with its almost crisp aftertaste.",87
Virginie Boone,Louis M. Martini 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"Slightly reduced, this wine offers a chalky, tannic backbone to an otherwise juicy explosion of rich black cherry, the whole accented throughout by firm oak and cigar box.",87
Kerin O’Keefe,Masseria Setteporte 2012 Rosso  (Etna),"This is dominated by oak and oak-driven aromas that include roasted coffee bean, espresso, coconut and vanilla that carry over to the palate, together with plum and chocolate. Astringent, drying tannins give it a rather abrupt finish.",87
Matt Kettmann,Mirassou 2012 Chardonnay (Central Coast),"Building on 150 years and six generations of winemaking tradition, the winery trends toward a leaner style, with the classic California buttercream aroma cut by tart green apple. In this good everyday sipping wine, flavors that range from pear to barely ripe pineapple prove approachable but not distinctive.",87
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Richard Böcking 2013 Devon Riesling (Mosel),"Zesty orange peels and apple notes abound in this sprightly, mineral-toned Riesling. Off dry on the palate, yet racy and lean, it's a refreshing, easy quaffer with wide appeal.",87
Michael Schachner,Felix Lavaque 2010 Felix Malbec (Cafayate),"Baked plum, molasses, balsamic vinegar and cheesy oak aromas feed into a palate that's braced by a bolt of acidity. A compact set of saucy red-berry and plum flavors features tobacco and peppery accents, while the finish is mildly green in flavor, with respectable weight and balance.",87
Michael Schachner,Gaucho Andino 2011 Winemaker Selection Malbec (Mendoza),"Raw black-cherry aromas are direct and simple but good. This has a juicy feel that thickens over time, with oak character and extract becoming more apparent. A flavor profile driven by dark-berry fruits and smoldering oak finishes meaty but hot.",87
Michael Schachner,Pradorey 2010 Vendimia Seleccionada Finca Valdelayegua Single Vineyard Crianza  (Ribera del Duero),"Desiccated blackberry, leather, charred wood and mint aromas carry the nose on this full-bodied, tannic, heavily oaked Tinto Fino. Flavors of clove and woodspice sit on top of blackberry fruit, then hickory and other forceful oak-based aromas rise up and dominate the finish.",87
Alexander Peartree,Quiévremont 2012 Meritage (Virginia),"Red fruit aromas pervade on the nose, with cigar box and menthol notes riding in the back. The palate is slightly restrained on entry, but opens up to riper notes of cherry and plum specked with crushed pepper.

Alexander Peartree,Quiévremont 2012 Vin de Maison Red (Virginia),"Ripe aromas of dark berries mingle with ample notes of black pepper, toasted vanilla and dusty tobacco. The palate is oak-driven in nature, but notes of tart red currant shine through, offering a bit of levity.",87
Paul Gregutt,Acrobat 2013 Pinot Noir (Oregon),"A sleek mix of tart berry, stem and herb, along with a hint of oak and chocolate, this is a fair value in a widely available, drink-now Oregon Pinot. The wine oak-aged for six months, whether in neutral or re-staved is not indicated.",87
Kerin O’Keefe,Baglio di Pianetto 2007 Ficiligno White (Sicilia),"Delicate aromas recall white flower and citrus. The palate offers passion fruit, lime and white peach with a hint of mineral alongside bright acidity.",87
Matt Kettmann,Bianchi 2011 Signature Selection Merlot (Paso Robles),"This wine from the Geneseo district offers aromas of sour plums and just enough cigar box to tempt the nose.

Kerin O’Keefe,Canicattì 2009 Aynat Nero d'Avola (Sicilia),"Aromas of prune, blackcurrant, toast and oak carry through to the extracted palate, along with flavors of black cherry and roasted coffee beans. Firm but drying tannins provide the framework.",87
Virginie Boone,Castello di Amorosa 2011 King Ridge Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Oak and earth intermingle around robust aromas of wet forest floor in this vineyard-designated Pinot that hails from a high-elevation site. Small in production, it offers intense, full-bodied raspberry and blackberry steeped in smoky spice and smooth texture.",87

Virginie Boone,Clarksburg Wine Company 2010 Chenin Blanc (Clarksburg),"Clarksburg is becoming a haven for Chenin Blanc in California. This bottling, using fruit sourced from several vineyards in the area, is balanced with just a trace of sweetness in the background (1% residual sugar). This is crisp, straightforward and blessed with notes of pear and lime. Drink it cold.",86

,Duca di Salaparuta 2010 Calanìca Nero d'Avola-Merlot Red (Sicilia),"Merlot and Nero d'Avola form the base for this easy red wine that would pair with fettuccine and meat sauce or pork roast. The quality of the fruit is clean, bright and sharp.",86
,Duca di Salaparuta 2011 Calanìca Grillo-Viognier White (Sicilia),"Part of the extended Calanìca series, this Grillo-Viognier blend shows aromas of honeysuckle and jasmine, backed by touches of cut grass and wild sage. In the mouth, it shows ripe yellow-fruit flavors.",86

,Envolve 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma Valley),"This shows a tart, green gooseberry flavor that is similar to New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc. Other notes include tropical fruit, orange and honey. Unoaked, with a splash of Muscat, this has commendable dryness and acidity.",86
Paul Gregutt,Erath 2010 Hyland Pinot Noir (McMinnville),"As with many of the Erath 2010 vineyard designates, this is strongly herbal. The notes of leaf and herb create somewhat unripe flavor impressions, with a touch of bitterness on the finish. The fruit just passes the ripeness of sweet tomatoes.",86
Michael Schachner,Estampa 2011 Estate Viognier-Chardonnay (Colchagua Valley),"White flower, lychee and apple aromas carry the mellow bouquet. The chunky-feeling palate bears powdery, sweet flavors of peach and melon, mixed with greener notes of grass and lime. The 80% Viognier component is typical of the warm climate: plump and oily, with a short finish. Chardonnay fills out the blend.",86

Roger Voss,Henry Fessy 2012 Nouveau  (Beaujolais),"This is a festive wine, with soft, ripe fruit and acidity, plus a red berry flavor.",86
,Robert Hall 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Paso Robles),"The clean, brisk mouthfeel gives this slightly oaked Sauvignon Blanc instant likeability. It's dry with a rich streak of honey that sweetens the citrus, pear and tropical fruit flavors. Pair this with Asian fare, ham or a green salad with grapefruit sections.",86
Michael Schachner,Sundance 2011 Merlot (Maule Valley),"A berry aroma comes with cola and herb notes. The palate is tangy and racy, and it delivers raspberry and plum flavors, with a modest finish.",86
,Tarara 2010 #SocialSecret Red (Virginia),"Right out of the starting blocks this is an oaky wine, dripping with caramel and vanilla notes. The texture on the midpalate is finessed and graceful, with drying tannins that latch onto the oak-driven finish. An eccentric blend of 50% Tannat, 35% Petit Verdot and 15% Pinotage.",86

Roger Voss,Vignerons de Bel Air 2011 Eté Indien  (Brouilly),"Soft and fruity, this is a generous, ripe wine that's full of juicy red-cherry fruits and gentle tannins. It has some richness, giving a sweet character to this open, ready-to-drink wine.",86
,Viticultori Associati Canicatti 2008 Scialo Red (Sicilia),"This blend of Nero d'Avola and Syrah opens with savory aromas of cured meat, dried berry, cassis, tobacco and wet earth. There's a touch of almond bitterness on the finish.",86
Michael Schachner,Casa Silva 2008 Gran Reserva Petit Verdot (Colchagua Valley),"This is much different than Casa Silva's 2009 Petit Verdot, which was tasted in the same flight. The '08 is more hard, spicy and tarry, with a leafy, herbal aroma, plus some grittiness. The palate feels snappy, with a can't-miss saltiness. The finish is long in length but short on fruit, with a raw feel.",85
,Cantine di Dolianova 2010 Dolia  (Monica di Sardegna),"The Monica grape often shows a rustic or raw quality, with aromas of cherry cola, black pepper and sour fruit. This expression does just that, with an added touch of bright acidity on the finish.",85

,Tasca d'Almerita 2011 Sallier de la Tour Grillo (Sicilia),"There's a touch of toasted almond at the start, but then this Grillo revs up in the glass to deliver notes of citrus, stone fruit, crushed stone and lemon tart. The mouthfeel is crisp and simple.",85

Sean P. Sullivan,Mellisoni 2014 Malbec (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Aromas of cranberry, barrel spice and herb are followed by tart cranberry flavors with grainy tannins. It falls a bit flat and the variety seems hard to discern.",86

Roger Voss,Simonnet-Febvre 2015  Chablis,"From the warm 2015 vintage, this is a soft and fruity wine. It's open with broad white fruit flavors, the acidity lighter than usual for Chablis, giving it a particularly ripe character. Drink now.",86
Roger Voss,Vignerons des Terres Secrètes 2015  Mâcon-Milly Lamartine,"This soft, rounded wine is ripe with generous pear and melon flavors. It's easy and ready to drink young for its smooth, attractively ripe character.",86
Sean P. Sullivan,Basel Cellars 2013 Inspired Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A blend of Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this wine brings disjointed lightly volatile aromas of wood spice, vanilla and cherry. The plump cherry flavors are rounded out by woody barrel notes.",86
Jim Gordon,Cocobon 2014 Red (California),"Very deep in color and spicy-smoky in flavor, this full-bodied wine is packed with dark-fruit flavors like blackberry and blueberry. Aromas like grilled beef and spicy flavors like cardamom and smoke give it a bold character that's hard to deny.",86

Virginie Boone,Hindsight 2013 Bella Vetta Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),"Juicy plum, raspberry and pencil lead lead the way in this vineyard designate, a site that's 2,000 feet high.

Paul Gregutt,Z'IVO 2015 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"Some rosés are made simply by bleeding the juice from the fermenter, to concentrate the remaining wine.

Roger Voss,Adega Cooperativa do Cartaxo 2014 Bridão Touriga Nacional (Tejo),"Grown on the sandy soil of Tejo, the wine is typically soft and open. It is very accessible—with black fruits and light tannins for this grape. It is ready to drink.",86
Michael Schachner,Aresti 2014 Special Release Reserva Carmenère (Rapel Valley),"Caramelized oak and vanilla aromas are front and center on a barrel-heavy nose. This feels a bit choppy, with astringent tannins. Herbal salty plum flavors wear a lot of oaky makeup, while this finishes with a forced woody flavor.",86
Michael Schachner,Spyro 2014 Albariño (Rías Baixas),"Bland, mature aromas of white fruits are on the weak side for Albariño. This feels round and oily, while briny leesy flavors lack pop and precision. A grabby aged finish is short on the free flow that this grape and region are known for. Drink immediately or wait for a newer vintage.",86

Kerin O’Keefe,Poggio Alloro 2014 Le Mandorle Riserva  (Vernaccia di San Gimignano),"Subdued aromas of French oak, toast and acacia waft out of the glass.

Kerin O’Keefe,Fattoria Sardi 2015 Rosato (Toscana),"Made primarily from Sangiovese, with some Malvasia and other white grapes, this offers aromas of red berry and a yeasty whiff of bread dough.

Sean P. Sullivan,Gård 2014 Grand Klasse Reserve Lawrence Vineyards Viognier (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Barrel notes are prominent, with aromas of Creamsicle and baking spice. The palate is broad and dry with stone-fruit and barrel flavors. It provides intrigue but the wood seems to get in the way at times.",88
Roger Voss,Henry Fessy 2015  Juliénas,"This is a dense wine, packed with both tannins and acidity. It brings out the ageworthiness of this appellation with its rich potential and dark mineral texture. Drink this concentrated cru wine from 2018.",88

Anna Lee C. Iijima,Heron Hill 2015 Ingle Vineyard Riesling (Finger Lakes),A wisp of bramble extends a savory tone from nose to finish on this otherwise bright bristling wine.

Virginie Boone,Soquel Vineyards 2013 Intreccio Library Selection Red (Napa Valley),"This blends 20% each of all five red-Bordeaux varieties, showing grapy, plummy flavor that's juicy and soft on the palate.

Matt Kettmann,Pull 2012 BDX Red (Paso Robles),"Tar, dried meat, olallieberry and sharp cedar aromas show on this blend of 51% Cabernet Sauvignon and 49% Merlot. Dried strawberries and plums mix with thyme and dried rose petals on the palate.",87
Matt Kettmann,Pull 2013 Chardonnay (Paso Robles),"Poached pears, yellow apples and a touch of butter show on the classic nose of this Chardonnay that holds to steely frame. Very sharp acidity kicks off the sip, where Pink Lady apples and warm vanilla surround a tight minerality. It's both sharp and slightly sweet.",87
Matt Kettmann,R2 2013 Camp 4 Vineyard Grenache Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),"The distinctive nose on this bottling is tight yet tropical, with mango, pineapple, pear skins, orange rinds, dried lime peels and a gin-like juniper all converging. The palate offers a balance between tightly woven texture and ripe tropicality, with lime rinds, mango and petrol touches.",87
Matt Kettmann,Rideau 2014 Estate Syrah,"Baked red cherry, crushed clove, iron and rose petals make for standard aromas on this bottling, although they are fairly light and simple here. There is a sizzle of acitity on the palate, where juicy strawberry and olallieberry flavors are easy to enjoy, made more complex by graphite and cedar touches.",87
Kerin O’Keefe,Tenuta Forconi 2013 Toscano Red (Toscana),"A blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 20% Sangiovese, this offers aromas of black currant, caramel and mocha. The dense palate delivers toast, leather and cedar alongside teeth-coating tannins that grip the finish.",87
,Dopff & Irion 2004 Schoenenbourg Grand Cru Vendanges Tardives Riesling (Alsace),"Medium-gold in color. Complex and inviting nose layered with a strong earthy minerality, vibrant bright fruit and intriguing notes of petrol and honey. On the palate it is racy, taut and focused full of well defined ripe succulent citrus and stone fruit. Rich, viscous texture perfectly balanced by the wine's crispness and almost steely minerality. Very long, juicy, lingering finish.",92
,Ceretto 2003 Bricco Rocche Prapó  (Barolo),"Slightly backward, particularly given the vintage, the wine has a complex nose with plenty of dark fruit, Turkish delight, smoked meat and earth. A full rich palate, slightly soft, it begins to run out of steam a little in mid palate, but returns with a flourish, and the finish is long and nuanced. Will repay 5+ years of cellaring.",92
,Matrix 2007 Stuhlmuller Vineyard Chardonnay (Alexander Valley),"The vineyard is one of the better Chardonnay sources in Alexander Valley, and in this fine vintage it lends ripe pineapple, pear, Key lime pie and Mandarin orange flavors to the wine. Lots of toasty new oak adds buttered toast and vanilla, but the wood influence is in balance. Classic Burgundian-style California Chardonnay, rich and opulent.",92
,Mauritson 2007 Rockpile Cemetary Vineyard Zinfandel (Rockpile),"Defines Rockpile Zinfandel in intensity of fruit and high alcohol which is in keeping with the volume. There are few red wines in the world like this. It's fully dry, with potent flavors of baked blackberries, blackcurrants, cola and peppery spices, and the tannins are huge, but negotiable. Demands the richest grilled meats and cheeses.",92
Joe Czerwinski,Henry's Drive Vignerons 2006 Parson's Flat Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon (Padthaway),"The blend is roughly two-thirds Shiraz and one-third Cabernet, and the result combines berries with cassis and generosity with structure, all framed by toasty oak. Savory in character, long and dusty on the finish. Drink now-2018.",92
,Silverado 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This sophisticated wine is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, which accounts for the firm tannins and dense structure as well as most of the blackberries and blackcurrants. Smaller amounts of Merlot and Cabernet Franc add cherries and violets, while oak contributes smoky complexities. Rich and elegant, the wine provides lovely drinking now.",92
Roger Voss,Le Riche 2003 Cabernet Sauvignon Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Stellenbosch),"Etienne Le Riche is a total Cabernet specialist. With a tiny production of 5,000 cases across all his wines, this is boutique in the best sense. The Reserve Cabernets are, of course, the stars. This 2003 is fruit and wood driven, a powerful but still elegant wine, with black plums, tannins and super-ripe fruits.",91
,Pierre Sparr 2007 Vendages Tardives Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"Mid-gold color. Pronounced and enticing aromas of ripe citrus and stone fruit, layered with honey and floral notes with a touch of sweet spice. Rich and creamy texture packed with sweet ripe juicy fruit, honey, spice and a twist of sage. Off-dry, deliciously smooth with fresh acidity and medium-body. An elegant wine with a long, creamy, spicy finish.",91
,Pierre Sparr 2008 Alsace One White (Alsace),"Attractive mid-gold color with intense aromas of ripe citrus and stone fruit, strong minerality and hints of spice. Racy with crisp acidity, juicy, rich and smooth texture with lots of concentrated, bright flavors of blood orange, peach, apricot, mango and spice. Strong minerality follows through to a long, precise, juicy finish.",91
,Kuentz-Bas 2008 Pinot Blanc (Alsace),"Compelling minerality on the nose, Refined and focused floral aromas with ample ripe stone fruit and a hint of petrol. Racy acidity and lovely taut palate with generous layers of juicy ripe peach, apricot and nectarine.  Strong minerality prevails across the palate leading to a lingering finish. Very balanced.",91
,Camberley 2004 Philosophers' Stone Red (Stellenbosch),"A big, black bruiser of a wine that has black olive flavors and aromas and plenty beyond. Raspberry, mulberry, vanilla and spice all vie on the nose, while the palate is so dark it´s tough to discern the plum and leather flavors. Give it three years and reap the benefits.",91
,Ceretto 2003 Bricco Rocche Brunate  (Barolo),"At the first it was quite muted and subdued, but over a ten minute period it developed beautifully in the glass. The dark fruit is still dominant, but it is beginning to show some interesting tertiary aromas of earth, mushrooms and leather. Well balanced with a medium finish. Needs a few more years, but can be enjoyed now with a good deal of pleasure.",91
,Dopff & Irion 2008 Gentil White (Alsace),"Attractive mid-gold color. Compelling layers of tangy citrus and stone fruit aromas with notes of honey and earthy minerality. Intense flavors of honey, tangy orange citrus, sweet peach and apricot that are both rich and juicy.  Crisp acidity provides a perfect balance for the slight sweetness on the finish. Taut and focused.",91
Roger Voss,Delheim 2001 Grand Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Simonsberg-Stellenbosch),"A Cabernet-dominated (98%) wine, which boasts a dense, concentrated tannic structure. Flavors of cassis underly this, while the wood spices contribute their ribbon of flavor. This is an impressive wine, the flagship red from this estate founded by Spatz Sperling over 30 years ago.",91
,Poderi Luigi Einaudi 2003  Barolo,"Einaudi's wines have been improving lately, and this Barolo was very impressive, given the trying conditions of the vintage. Big rich, fat with smoked meat and a good dose of oak, the wine was one of the few that didn't peter out early but stayed on the palate to the end, culminating in an nice easy finish.",91
,Clark-Clauden 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Give this young Cab time in the cellar to come around. Right now, it's fresh and tannic, with primary fruit blackberry and cherry flavors, and the sweet smoky oak hasn't been integrated. Should knit together over the next 4-6 years, at least.",91
,Giacomo Ascheri 2001 Sorano  (Barolo),"The color is just beginning to show signs of browning at the edge, but the wine is still fresh and vibrant. The nose is complex, showing licorice, summer fruits, caramel and roses. On the palate, it is soft and pleasant, but lacks some concentration.  At its peak, but will drink well for a few years.",91
Joe Czerwinski,Lassègue 2003  Saint-Émilion,"This wine's black cherry and plum flavors veer dangerously toward prune—no doubt a product of the exceedingly hot summer. It's creamy and supple in texture, adding just enough tobacco, vanilla and smoke for complexity. But for all the fruit and ripeness, it finishes with great elegance and precision. Drink now–2020. Imported by Acadia Imports.",91
Roger Voss,Beaumont 2005 Hope Marguerite Chenin Blanc (Walker Bay),"This is great Chenin Blanc, wood fermented but still leaving all the varietal character. Rich, creamy, almond flavors and silky smooth, which keeps all the essential acidity of the grape, with added spice and vanilla.",90
,Dopff & Irion 2008 Crustacés White (Alsace),"Mid-gold color. Very mineral driven with subtle aromas of bruised apple and stone fruit compote. Crisp, fairly taut palate showing strong minerality and ripe flavors of red apple, cantaloupe, sweet nectarine and spice. Taut and precise texture with a long, slightly austere finish.",90
,Kuentz-Bas 2007 Cuvée Jerémy Sélection de Grains Nobles Pinot Gris (Alsace),"Beautiful deep gold color. Intense, concentrated nose with vibrant aromas of honey, citrus marmalade and savory botrytis notes. Deliciously sweet and succulent, yet balanced by good acidity.  Packed with flavors of sweet ultra-ripe stone and tropical fruit, with honey and botrytis notes following through. Strong minerality prevails to a long, complex finish.",90
,Poderi Colla 2005 Costa Bruna  (Barbera d'Alba),"A big, fat, luscious wine with plenty of toasty oak, dark jammy fruit and spices. The palate showed the same lushness; with the fruit front and center with surprising length.  A delicious, rather hefty effort short on finesse but long on flavor.",90
,Giacomo Ascheri 2003 Vigna dei Pola  (Barolo),"This is one of the more complex wines from the 2003 vintage. The nose has aromas of blackberry liquer, smoked meat, truffle and road tar. On the palate the fruit seems a little heavier and more roasted, but still melds well with its earthy, mushroomy flavors. Medium finish.",90
,Banyan 2007 Riesling (Santa Lucia Highlands),"A beautiful wine, sleek, crisp and ultra-dry, with the most refined flavors of petrol, white peach, kaffir lime, apricot skin and minerals. The acidity is very high and palate-cleansing. The wine was half fermented in barrels, half in stainless steel. Sommeliers, buy this by the case, if you can find it.",90
,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2007 Hunawihr Clos Windsbuhl Pinot Gris (Alsace),"Rich gold in color. Broad, layered aromas of very ripe fruit with hints of sweet smoke, brown sugar, honey and a savory earthy minerality. Full-bodied, bone dry, but richly textured with crisp acidity and a wide palette of flavors, ripe stone fruit, a creamy savory earthiness, sage and a balsamic kick on the finish. Very long length, slightly warm but with a lingering savory, mineral finish.",90
Virginie Boone,Terra Valentine 2013 K Block Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District),"Thick and brooding, this dark, sweetly tannic wine also offers higher-toned elements of cedar, dried herb and graphite. It finds its balance amid a full-bodied density of fruit concentration and girth of structure. Drink now through 2023.",91
Matt Kettmann,Testarossa 2013 Guidotti Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Cooked cranberry is spiced with anise, peppercorn and roasted beef slices on this bottling from a vineyard planted by three brothers who are longtime Salinas Valley farmers. The palate shows dark cranberry and raspberry, spiced up by chopped sage, thyme and bay leaf.",91
Matt Kettmann,Vincent Vineyards 2010 Family Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Ynez Valley),"There's a touch of hot asphalt, pencil lead and miso on the nose of this first vintage from a promising, well-funded project, with dark elderberry fruit and dried dill rounding out the aromas. The palate blends a gamy beef quality with oregano, marjoram, cooked strawberry, baked blackberry and a sesame-oil character.",91
Matt Kettmann,Vincent Vineyards 2012 Family Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Ynez Valley),"Black cherry, black plum and black currant are integrated well into the fresh dill and smoke scents on the nose of this wine from one of the region's newest properties. It discloses a rich dark-chocolate sauce character on the palate as well as black-currant-jelly flavors, but most impressive is the lush, sexy and soft mouthfeel.",91
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Weingut Liebfrauenstift 2014 Dry Riesling (Rheinhessen),"Crisp, pristine peach and apricot notes resonate through the nose and palate of this fresh, blossomy dry Riesling. While zesty and lithe in body, ripe grapefruit and melon flavors feel supple and silky on the palate. Drink now through 2019.",91
Matt Kettmann,Wrath 2013 Destruction Level Red (Monterey),"Smashed blackberry and blueberry fruit are enhanced by burned caramel, heavy slate and touches of soy and smoke on the nose. There's great depth in both body and flavors once sipped, with a layer of fine-grained tannins revealing teriyaki, black plum, boysenberry and touches of lavender.",91
Virginie Boone,Yardstick 2013 Ruth's Reach Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This wine shows off Yountville fruit at its finest, starting with a floral component to the nose. Spicy, bright and lifted, it coats the palate in ripe berry and cherry, ending with a snap of vanilla.",91
Roger Voss,Herdade Grande 2014 Gerações Colheita Seleccionada Branco White (Alentejano),"This bottling shows a rich, wood-aged wine, full of ripe yellow and tropical fruits as well as rich toasty flavors. The wine is warm, rounded, spicy and with its impressive structure still developing, it has the potential to age well. The wine is named to celebrate the second Lança generation in charge at the estate. Drink from 2017.",91
Matt Kettmann,Albatross Ridge 2012 Estate Reserve Pinot Noir (Carmel Valley),"From a promising new project, the nose of this wine is linear and focused, with black raspberry, black licorice, cola, wet sagebrush and rain-on-slate scents. The tactile acidity once sipped creates a fascinating soft buzz on the tongue, with flavors of dried mint, brisk raspberry and cherry tomato. Camphor and eucalyptus add intrigue on the finish.",91
Matt Kettmann,Alta Colina 2012 Old 900 Syrah (Paso Robles),"Dark and thick in the glass, this wine shows strong but not bitter tar notes on the nose plus charred beef in a blueberry glaze, wet campfire, bourbon barrel and vanilla. The structure is massive now, gooey with thick tannins and flavors of espresso bean and condensed purple flowers. Judicious acidity ensures strong cellaring potential. Drink 2018–2027.",91
Michael Schachner,Marques de Griñon 2010 Single Vineyard Estate Bottled Graciano (Dominio de Valdepusa),"Ripe aromas of raisin, black plum and horsehide are pointy and peppery. On the palate, this Graciano is bold and energetic, with lifting acidity. Loud berry flavors come with strong accents of dark chocolate and bitter espresso, while the finish is long but just moderate in complexity. Drink through 2020.",91
Matt Kettmann,Big Basin 2013 Syrah (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Bradley Brown's appellation blend is a nice entry point to this exciting winery. This wine shows lavish smoked black currant and plum flavors, with aromatically lifting spices of anise and black pepper and a savory roast-beef element. The palate packs lots of pepper and relies on plump black cherry, boysenberry and a dark-chocolate syrup richness.",91
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Carl Graff 2014 Graacher Himmelreich Spätlese Riesling (Mosel),"Approachably fruity yet nuanced and electrifying, there's exceptional value here. High-intensity flavors of tangerine and stone fruit sweeten the palate, balanced by nerve-tingling acidity and deep ripples of slate, salt and honeycomb. It's an intensely zesty wine, but the finish has length and power.",91
Roger Voss,Casa Santa Vitória 2013 Grande Reserva Tinto Red (Alentejano),"From an estate in the south of the Alentejo, this is a rich, hot-country wine. It is firm, densely structured and with solid, dark tannins. There is a juicy black fruit background to this dense wine that gives a lift. Still young, this dark and very concentrated wine will be better from 2018.",91
Kerin O’Keefe,Castello di Gabbiano 2012 Bellezza Gran Selezione  (Chianti Classico),"Baked plum, Asian spice, vanilla and menthol aromas carry the nose. The elegantly structured palate offers fleshy black cherry, licorice, mint and well-integrated French oak alongside fine-grained tannins that lend firm, polished support. A coffee note marks the finish.",91
Kerin O’Keefe,Castello Romitorio 2011 Filo di Seta  (Brunello di Montalcino),"Intense aromas of ripe red berry, menthol, espresso and star anise lead the nose. The concentrated palate offers cranberry, dried Morello cherry, sage and licorice alongside close-grained tannins that grip the finish. Drink from 2018 through 2025.",91
Roger Voss,Château Vincens 2012 Malbec (Cahors),"Low-yield vines on the best parcels of the Vincens estate are the source of this wine. It is super-rich and concentrated, maybe too much in its opulent excess. The wine does have great plum and berry flavors that are generous and full in the mouth. The wine even now is still young and will be better from 2018.",91
Matt Kettmann,Chronic Cellars 2013 Mr. Nibbles Red (Paso Robles),"A hearty blend of 76% Zinfandel and 24% Petite Sirah, this bottling packs a wallop of cinnamon-stick on the nose as well as strawberry puree, licorice and black pepper. Clove, allspice, and nutmeg arise immediately on the sip, backed by baked plum and bay leaf notes.",91
Matt Kettmann,Claiborne & Churchill 2014 Claiborne Vineyard Riesling (Edna Valley),"More complex than the winery's appellation blend, yet also requiring time to reach full potential, this shows delicate lemon slices, honeysuckle, surf wax, pink grapefruit and a touch of coconut on the nose. The palate is grippy in texture and sizzling with mouthwatering acidity, offering lemon rind, grapefruit spritz and petrol flavors. Expect inviting nut and honey-dust flavors to emerge. Drink 2018–2034.",91
Roger Voss,Collin-Bourisset 2011 Hospices Civils de Romanèche Thurins  (Moulin-à-Vent),"Produced from vineyards donated to a charitable hospital in the 19th century, this wine is rich and now perfectly mature. It has smoky tannins that lie under the fine, elegant cherry and red plum fruits and acidity. The wine still has freshness although the attraction here is the ripe structure. The ornate label dates back to 1926.",91
Michael Schachner,Conde de Velázquez 2012 Condesa Real Premium Blend Red (Aconcagua Valley),"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot opens with blackened aromas of charred oak and creosote, but it quickly sheds that oak-heavy character to display toasty flavors of olives, herbs and berry fruits. All together, this is a classic Chilean red blend, with fine tannins and patented lightly herbal, balsamic flavors. Drink through 2020.",91
Michael Schachner,Cono Sur 2012 20 Barrels Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),"Dry, briary aromas of field brush, black olive, herbs, berry fruits and saucy tomato are textbook Maipo. This is fresh, a touch choppy, and not overly heavy. Flavors of cassis, plum and vanilla carry over to the finish, which is fresh and bolstered by fine natural acidity. Drink through 2022.",91
Roger Voss,Domaine Berthoumieu 2013 Charles de Batz Tannat-Cabernet (Madiran),"Of course, this 90% Tannat wine is still very young. But it's impressive, rich and concentrated and promises to age well. It is dense with both tannins and fruit, black plum and berry flavors dominating, cut by acidity. It will be ready to drink from 2019.",91
Matt Kettmann,Dracaena 2013 Cabernet Franc (Paso Robles),"The addition of 15% Petite Sirah takes this bottling to a compelling place, showing barely ripe blackberries, animal fat, smoke, black pepper and a wild clove element on the nose. It's rich and layered on the palate, where chalky tannins support black cherry, grilled beef and mint flavors. This has the bones to last awhile.",91
Virginie Boone,Duckhorn 2012 Rector Creek Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley),"A fairly elegant expression of the variety, this wine is bright in cherry kirsch and pretty aromas of rose petal and lavender, structured to age and enjoy with food. Rector Creek Vineyard is just north of Yountville and planted in rocky alluvial soils. Drink now through 2022.",91
Virginie Boone,Dutton-Goldfield 2014 Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This wine is put together from multiple vineyard sources, including the well-known Morelli Lane and Widdoes, all farmed by the Duttons. Larger in production than many of the vineyard-designates, it offers baked bread and juicy overtones of cranberry-raspberry layered atop luxuriously toasted oak. It'll show well at the table.",91
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Fritz Haag 2014 Brauneberger Feinherb Riesling (Mosel),"Fresh and fragrant of blossoms, tart yellow peach and apricot, this off-dry Riesling maintains a crystalline fruit purity that persists throughout Fritz Haag's wines. It's invigorating and irresistably quaffable. The long, melon-rind finish is lip smacking.",91
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Fritz Haag 2014 Riesling (Mosel),"Just a touch of honey-lemon sweetness is enough to make this zesty, citrus-focused Riesling lip smackingly delicious. Fresh, green herb and lime notes reverberate through a strong finish. Drinks well now but should meld nicely over the next five years.",91
Michael Schachner,G7 2012 The 7th Generation Gran Reserva Estate Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Loncomilla Valley),"Dry, spicy aromas of tobacco, cedar, vanilla and berry fruits come together nicely. This Maule Valley Cab is fresh and harmonious across the palate, with nothing too pushy. Complex, balsamic flavors of olives, herbs, dried berries, turned earth and cocoa finish dry, peppery and elegant. Drink through 2019.",91
Paul Gregutt,Le Cadeau 2014 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This wine is bursting with gorgeous cherry fruit, forward and luscious. The tannins are ripe and the acids in perfect proportion, keeping the fruit flavors buoyed upon a textural ride into a lingering finish.",91
Joe Czerwinski,Stoneleigh 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"The Stoneleigh style traditionally favors ripeness over herbaceousness, and the 2008 holds true to form, offering up grapefruit and nectarine aromas and an appealing blend of citrus and stone-fruit flavors. It's plump and round, yet finishes fresh. Good as an apéritif or with light dishes.",88
,Tenuta Peter Sölva & Söhne 2007 De Silva Sauvignon (Alto Adige),"Crisp and fresh with enduring aromas of tomato leaf, citrus, pink grapefruit and white stone, this is textbook Sauvignon from the mountainous Alto Adige region of Italy. Pair it with appetizers or lightly spicy foods.",88
Michael Schachner,TerraMater 2006 Unusual Cabernet-Shiraz-Zinfandel Red (Maipo Valley),"Haven't seen this unusual combination of grapes in quite some time, and you know what, it's much better now than when we last saw it in 2001. This vintage has a nice, almost magnetic nose, while the palate is firm and well structured, with cassis, black cherry, coffee and licorice flavors. It's a bit boring on the finish, but the mouthfeel and length are just fine. Fruity, rich and balanced. 325 cases made.",88
,Isole e Olena 2005  Chianti Classico,"This Chianti Classico strikes a beautiful balance between elegance and intensity. It has both and its pretty aromas of wild berry, rose, ginger, anise and spice come forth in a continuous, steady manner. It feels bright and lively in the mouth and ends with a touch of piquant spice.",88
,Kenwood 2005 Jack London Vineyard Syrah (Sonoma Valley),"Black as a moonless night, dense in structure, tannic, bone dry and super-peppery, this Syrah isn't offering much relief right now. In all likelihood it will emerge from its cocoon in a few years to offer a wealth of ripe blackberry, currant and carob fruit.",88
Roger Voss,La Chablisienne 2006 Les Vénérables Vieilles Vignes  (Chablis),"The impact of 50-year old vines is seen in the concentrated fruit, ripe and full,  in this wine. The flavors are of fresh apricots, edged with green apples and pink grapefruit, a combination that shows both richness and great freshness. The finish is a reminder of the fine acidity in 2006.",88
,Manzoni 2006 Lucia Highland Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),"This is a strong, oaky Chardonnay. It's crisp in acidity and forward in pineapple jam, lemon custard and vanilla meringue flavors. If you like the ripe, California style, it's for you.",88
,McIntyre Vineyards 2006 Mission Ranch Pinot Noir (Arroyo Seco),"Crisp, coastal acidity dominates this wine, making it mouth-wateringly tart. May be too much for some folks, but it's quite elegant, with good cherry, black raspberry and cola flavors enriched with a touch of smoky oak.",88
,Abbadia Ardenga 2003 M. Vigna  (Brunello di Montalcino),"Loaded with bold, ripe fruit, exotic spice and leather, this is a simple but genuine expression of Brunello di Montalcino. The wine tastes thick and a bit chunky in the mouth because of its chewy, succulent tannins.",88
Michael Schachner,Alamos 2007 Torrontés (Salta),"With attractive melon and other tropical aromas, this is a Torrontés that rises above the masses. It smells great and tastes like a pure blend of lychee fruit, tangerine and honeydew melon. The palate feel is smooth and round, and the finish is dry, clean and healthy. It's everything that Torrontés should be. Drink now.",88
,Anaba 2007 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"This is a typical Sonoma Coast Chard in the bright acidity that firms up the ripe, long hangtime flavors. Pineapples, pears, peaches, nectarines and subtle papaya notes are joined with buttercream and cinnamon spices. Drink now.",88
Michael Schachner,Apaltagua 2007 Envero Gran Reserva Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),"Composed and structured, with its fair share of richness manifested as raisin and molasses. Interestingly, the palate rings with acidity, resulting in a feel that's borderline sharp. But there's enough fruit and heft to balance things out, and the flavors of cherry, blackberry and cola are nice. A good example of elevated Carmenère (with 10% Cabernet Sauvignon) that doesn't cost an arm and a leg.",88
,Harrington 2006 Wiley Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"This is a very rich Pinot whose primary virtue is fruit. It just explodes with delicious cherry jam, red currant, licorice and mocha flavors. Dry and crisply acidic, it's a beautiful wine for early drinking.",88
,Abbazia Santa Anastasia 2003 Montenero Red (Sicilia),"This is a luminous, mature red wine with thick concentration and huge—almost too much—emphasis on toasted oak. Aromas recall vanilla, spice and coffee, although you will find blueberry and cherry on the finish: It is a blend of Nero d'Avola, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot.",88
Michael Schachner,Viña Bisquertt 2007 Casa La Joya Reserve Merlot (Colchagua Valley),"Bisquertt usually does well with its value-priced Merlots, and seeing that 2007 was an excellent vintage in Chile, this wine excels in the value price range. The nose is dark and saturated, but pure and inviting. And the palate is ripe and smooth, with spice, plum, blackberry and herb notes, particularly anise. Finishes clean, smooth and peppery. Drink now.",88
Michael Schachner,Emiliana 2008 Natura Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley),"Clean and honest up front, with moderate richness and modest telltale Casablanca pineapple aromas. The plate is creamier than many wines in this price range, with flavors of apple cider, citrus and some pith. Overall this is a good value wine with enough citrus and acidity to qualify it as fresh.",87
,Fattoria Alois 2007 Campole Red (Campania),"Chocolate, espresso, plum and black currant are backed by smoky nuances and natural rubber. This muscular wine offers polished tannins and firm structure to the end. A bit of wine from the 2005 and 2006 vintages is blended in.",87
Joe Czerwinski,Henry's Drive Vignerons 2006 The Trial of John Montford Cabernet Sauvignon (Padthaway),"From the little-known region of Padthaway, this Cabernet starts off with some very promising, perfumed aromas of mint and cassis, but then shows touches of chocolate and raisined fruit on the palate. It's soft and mouthfilling—an easy-drinking Cab to consume on the young side.",87

The wine offers mature notes of cherry, clove, blackberry and cola: It tastes slightly sweet and very succulent.",87
Roger Voss,Bertrand Ambroise 2006  St.-Romain,"A citrus-dominated wine, lime and lemon giving a crisp intensity. There is a somewhat bitter toast element, but the acidity, the fresh fruits and the soft structure act as a counter-balance. Give it six months to a year. Screwcap.",87
,Campomaggio 2005  Chianti Classico,"Here's a traditional Chianti Classico with pretty aromas of cherry cola, mesquite, almonds and violets. The wine is compact and elegant in the mouth and offers crisp berry flavors on the close.",87
,Carpineto 2003 Riserva  (Vino Nobile di Montepulciano),"This is a mature, jammy wine with thick layers of plum, prune and raisin. The wine's appearance is dark and concentrated and that same sensation of heaviness carries over the palate in the form of black currant and spice. The tannins are firm and tart.",87
,Cesani 2007 Pancole  (Vernaccia di San Gimignano),"Pancole is a pretty expression of Tuscany's popular Vernaccia di San Gimignano with a luminous, bright appearance and pristine aromas of stone and passion fruits. The wine is lean and tonic with spicy notes on the finish.",87
Lauren Buzzeo,Spier 2014 21 Gables Chenin Blanc (Western Cape),"This is a concentrated, fairly full and lush Chenin, rich in toasty oak and vanilla cream as well as notes of baked apple pie and sweet orange.

Kerin O’Keefe,Tenuta di Sesta 2011 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),"Aromas of mature black-skinned berry, tobacco and dark spice lead the way.

Showing the heat of the vintage, this is evolving quickly so enjoy over the next several years.",90
Kerin O’Keefe,Terlan 2014 Nova Domus Riserva White (Alto Adige),"Made with 60% Pinot Bianco, 30% Chardonnay and 10% Sauvignon Blanc, this boasts appealing aromas of acacia flower, nectarine and Alpine herb. The elegant palate delivers juicy Gala apple, yellow peach and a touch of ginger alongside fresh acidity.",90
Mike DeSimone,Yatir 2011 Syrah (Judean Hills),"This wine features pleasing aromas of raspberry, jumper berry and black pepper. There is a nice mélange of fruit and spice flavors, notably black cherry, dark plums, anise, and cardamom. Smooth tannins ply the palate right into a bright finish that bears a touch of salinity.",90
Roger Voss,Adega Cooperativa de Borba 2012 Montes Claros Garrafeira Red (Alentejo),"A year in wood and 30 months in bottle before release have allowed this attractive wine to fully develop its solid yet smooth texture. It has concentration, layers of bright black currant fruit and vibrant acidity. Ready to drink.",90
Matt Kettmann,J. Lohr 2014 Gesture G-S-M (Paso Robles),"This bottling belongs to a series of wines from the legendary Jerry Lohr emphasizing Rhône varieties. It shows candied blackberry, violets and potpourri on the fruity, flowery and inviting nose. The palate leads with savory black pepper, which accents its core of black plum, blackberry and purple flower flavors.",90
Matt Kettmann,J. Lohr 2015 October Night Chardonnay (Arroyo Seco),"Rich honeysuckle, marzipan and oak aromas meet bright lemongrass on the nose of this bottling, showing both the fresh and oxidative sides of the grape. Smoked chicken and brioche notes are prominent on the palate, leading to a tangy, botanical, juniper-laced finish.",90
Virginie Boone,Courtney Benham 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is an extraordiary deal for a solidly built, high-level wine. It offers succulent cherry, raspberry and vanilla flavors, wrapped in approachable, mellowed tannin and oak.",90
Virginie Boone,Del Carlo Winery 2014 Home Ranch Teldeschi Vineyards Century Old Vine Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Juicy and austere in understated waves of cranberry and cherry fruit, this wine delivers subtle power and intensity in a leathery-textured package. True to its old vine heritage, it shows a dry dustiness of peppery spice.",90
Lauren Buzzeo,Delaire Graff 2013 Reserve White (Coastal Region),"A stony, flinty character leads the nose of this blend of 54% Sauvignon Blanc and 46% Sémillon, followed by scents of ripe peach, nectarine, freshly dried grass and herbs. The medium-weight palate offers more clean fruit flavors that result in a smooth, slightly creamy mouthfeel. Ample acidity lends freshness to the finish, alongside a lingering yellow flower character. Drink now–2019.",90
Joe Czerwinski,Domaine St Pierre 2014 Red (Côtes du Rhône),"Intriguing, thought provoking and complex, this wine starts off with perfumed aromas of thyme, bay leaf and lavender. It's supple in the mouth and silky in feel, imbued with black cherry and blueberry fruit, then shows a hint of adhesive bandage on the finish. Drink now.",90
Lauren Buzzeo,Eikendal 2014 Chardonnay (Western Cape),"This leads with clean yet soft scents of ripe apple, Anjoy pear and orange blossom. Those notes carry through to the medium-weight palate, well integrated with soft toasted-oak tones. It's harmonious and balanced, with ample acidity lending good lift through the close. Drink now.",90
Joe Czerwinski,Famille Perrin 2013 Les Christins Red (Vacqueyras),"This is taut and sinewy in profile, but shows off a fine range of aromas, from thyme and lavender to cocoa, red plum and ripe cherry. The raspberry and herb flavors finish in a storm of firm tannins. Drink 2020–2025.",90
Michael Schachner,Matarromera 2015 Fermentado en Barrica Verdejo (Rueda),"Mellow white-fruit aromas are nonspecific and oaky, but not overly so. This barrel-fermented Verdejo feels plump and chunky, with balancing acidity. Salty melon, apricot and apple flavors end steady and long. For barrel-fermented Verdejo, this is at the top of the pile.",90
Matt Kettmann,MCV 2014 1105 Red (Paso Robles),"This blend of 60% Petite Sirah, 21% Syrah, 7% Grenache, 6% Petit Verdot, 5% Tannat and 1% Viognier is tightly wound but likely to improve with time. Opened now, it offers elderberry, black currant, pencil lead and loam on the nose, with lava rock, crème de cassis and kirsch flavors slowing emerging on the palate.",90
Virginie Boone,Mounts 2014 Verah Red (Dry Creek Valley),"This is a big, brawny expression of Grenache, Mourvèdre, Syrah and Counoise, the Grenache playing the dominant role in the blend. It coats the palate in dense raspberry and blueberry fruit, seasoned with pepper and nutmeg. A leathery touch to the texture and lifted acidity keeps it from feeling heavy or overdone.",90
Mike DeSimone,Or Haganuz 2014 French Blend Red (Galilee),"Aromas of blackberry, fennel bulb and smoke set the scene for flavors of cherry, raspberry, chocolate and tobacco leaf. Mellow but ever-apparent tannins ply the palate alongside a strong bolt of acidity that tapers off into a pomegranate-imbued finish.",90
Kerin O’Keefe,Podere Scopetone 2012  Brunello di Montalcino,"Black-skinned berry, pipe tobacco and Mediterranean herb aromas waft out of the glass and carry over to the firm linear palate along with morello cherry, licorice and a hint of clove. Taut fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity provide the backbone while orange peel marks the finish. Drink 2019–2025.",90
Roger Voss,Quinta de Foz de Arouce 2013 Red (Beira Atlantico),"Wood aging gives this ripe blend of Baga and Touriga Nacional its richness and density. It's full of black fruit, toast and a touch of pepper. With ripe tannins and crisp acidity, it can easily age another year. Drink from 2018.",90
Virginie Boone,Robert Mondavi 2015 Fumé Blanc (Napa Valley),"Pithy, with grapefruit and lemon peel flavors, this wine is deceptively crisp and light on the nose, offering a wealth of body and lushness on the palate, accented with nutmeg and peach. It includes 4% Sémillon, partly from the winery's beloved To Kalon vineyard.",90
Jeff Jenssen,Samuel Tinon 2015 Megyer Dry Furmint (Tokaj),"From a vineyard in Northern Tokaj this dry Furmint has aromas of citrus pith and freshly cut pineapple. In the mouth, there are delightful flavors of grapefruit juice and white peach before the pleasantly acidic finish.",90
Virginie Boone,Sixteen by Twenty 2014 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"Briny green olive notes underlie a tropically ripe, full-bodied expression of the variety. The wine's apple, pineapple and mango fruit is wrapped in toasted oak and moderate acidity.",90
Kerin O’Keefe,St. Pauls 2014 Passion Riserva Pinot Bianco (Alto Adige),"This opens with enticing aromas of chamomile flower, white peach and a whiff of Alpine herb. The elegant palate offers McIntosh apple, candied lemon and a vein of energizing mineral. Fresh acidity lends balance.",90
Kerin O’Keefe,Talenti 2011 Trentennale  (Brunello di Montalcino),"Chopped herb, forest floor, leather, espresso and a balsamic note are some of the aromas that waft out of the glass. The powerfully structured palate delivers prune, dried cherry, tobacco, and roasted coffee bean framed in firm fine-grained tannins. Give the tannins a few more years to unwind then drink to capture the fruit richness. Drink 2018–2023.",90
Kerin O’Keefe,Terlan 2015 Pinot Bianco (Alto Adige),"Bright and creamy, this savory white offers aromas and flavors of ripe apple, Bartlett pear, Alpine herb and a citrus note. Fresh acidity and a mineral vein energize the finish.",90
Michael Schachner,Mendel 2014 Lunta Malbec (Luján de Cuyo),"Blackberry and road-tar aromas are dark and stout. This is moderately tannic and a bit rough and jagged on the palate. Flavors of stewed black plum and prune are ripe almost to an extreme, and that's how it finishes as well.",90
Lauren Buzzeo,Oldenburg 2013 Chardonnay (Stellenbosch),"There's a pleasant, toasty seam throughout the nose and mouth of this well-balanced wine, expressed in notes of sweet spice and honeycomb that frame the yellow melon and apple fruit core. It's plush and mouthfilling, but not flabby or overdone, thanks to balancing acidity and an assertive spicy tone that dominates the finish. Drink now.",90
Lauren Buzzeo,Oldenburg 2014 Chenin Blanc (Stellenbosch),"This is a round and rich wine, with notes of wood-grilled apple, guava and toasted challah. Smooth and lush in feel, ripe peach and tropical tones drive the palate, while hints of honeysuckle and baking spice unfold on the finish. Ample acidity keeps the wine's weight in check. Drink now.",90
,Wagner 2006 Grace House Pinot Noir (Finger Lakes),"The deep ruby color belies this wines cool-climate origins. The nose shows more black fruit aromas than is typical for Pinot Noir. The palate is all Pinot, though, with cherry pie filling flavors made more complex by vanilla from toasty new oak. It finishes with some nice mineral and earth notes. Silky tannins allow for immediate consumption but the wine will gain in complexity after a year or two in the cellar.",85
,Treleaven 2006 Semi-Dry Riesling (Cayuga Lake),"A thoroughly honest effort, opening with lovely quince, apple and lemon fruit. The palate has a crisp lime edge and finishes with a kick of refreshing acidity. Drink now.",85
,Benessere 2005 Costa Del Sol Red (Napa Valley),"Not clear what the varietal blend is, but it's like a nice, easy southern Rhône wine. Soft and fruity, it's rich in jammy blackberry, cherry, Mandarin orange, chocolate and anise spice flavors.",85
Susan Kostrzewa,Bloomer Creek 2006 Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes),"Orange blossom and flowers lead on this Gewürtz, and on the palate, a citric, lemon edge outweighs the sweet and floral components that would give this wine a prettier edge. Nonetheless, the wine has an attractive, crisp and clean character and will pair well with grilled seafood and poultry.",85
Michael Schachner,Andean Sky 2007 Bonarda (Mendoza),"Meaty and rubbery, but that's young Bonarda. This is a sound wine with dark berry flavors, raisin and pulsing acidity. Still, there's modest roundness to the palate and length to the finish. Overall, it's tasty, full and borderline raisiny. Drink now.",85
,Angove's 2006 Red Belly Black Shiraz (South Australia),Lifted cedar and pine notes interspersed with appealing woodsy scents give way to a surprisingly intense palate that shows some nice peppery notes but ultimately falls short on the finish. Nearly imperceptible tannins suggest early consumption.,85
Paul Gregutt,Silvan Ridge 2006 Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"There is an odd, piercing edge to the aromas, a mix of acetic acid and pungent herb, with a hint of diesel. Somehow it's not off-putting, just atypical. The light, tart fruit is a mix of rhubarb and cranberry, very earthy and tasting of dirt and bark in the finish. This could be quite pleasant with a hearty, rustic dish such as beef Bourgogne.",85
,Talamonti 2007 Cerasuolo Rosè  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo),"Neutral and unassuming on first impact, this luminous rosé eventually delivers notes of mineral, ash, stone fruit and small berry. The wine offers more in the mouth, however, where it exhibits fresh flavors of raspberry and blueberry.",85
,Testarossa 2006 Thompson Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"Overly sweet and simple, and something of a disappointment given the winery's past performance, this Syrah tastes like melted cherry jam, stirred with chocolate pie filling and sprinkled with fennel and pepper.",85
,Meeker 2004 Kiss Ridge Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),"Shows rich, firm mountain tannins and well-ripened, concentrated flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants and cocoa, and is thoroughly dry. But the wine loses a few points for hot caramelization, which may be partly over-charred oak and partly shriveled, overripe berries, if not both.",85
,Consorzio Vini Tipici di San Marino NV Moscato (San Marino),"The wine boasts a beautiful appearance thanks to its saturated golden color and faint amber highlights. It has a very fragrant nose and offers honey, peach and soapy floral notes. In the mouth, the wine delivers sweet fruit and a soft, silky texture.",85
Joe Czerwinski,D'Arenberg 2006 The Derelict Vineyard Grenache (McLaren Vale),"The sort of wine one imagines early Australian settlers gulped down—big and burly in the mouth and a bit warm, rough and dusty on the finish. Hints of mint-accented cherry fruit and earthy notes.",85
,Dogwood 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendocino),"A little rough and rugged, with jangly tannins and blackberry fruit so ripe it veers into raisins. Very dry, it's probably at its best now.",85
Roger Voss,Domaine du Tariquet 2007 Ugni Blanc-Colombard (Vin de Pays des Côtes de Gascogne),"Dominated by Ugni Blanc, the grape also used in the local Armagnac brandy, this is a tight, crisp wine, green but not unpleasantly so. Its acidity comes from fresh apple flavors, touched with some good juiciness and a fine refreshing finish. Screwcap.",85
,Falcor 2005 Sangiovese (Napa Valley),"Sweetly rich in cherry, red currant and chocolate flavors, with a peppery edge, this Sangiovese is soft in structure. The bright acidity can cut through tomato sauce with cheese.",85
,Hayman & Hill 2007 Reserve Selection Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Made in the modern California style, with very ripe, rather sweet pineapple jam, green apple butter and smoky oak flavors that are wrapped into a creamy texture.",85
,Hermann J. Wiemer 2002 Blanc de Blanc Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),"This sparkling wine starts with a toasty but soft nose, leading into clean but fruity flavors and a refreshing finish. Though an earlier release might have allowed more primary fruit to show through, the wine offers easygoing but elegant enjoyment.",85
Michael Schachner,J. & F. Lurton 2007 Herederos de François Lurton Villafrance de Duero Red (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León),"Simple but well-maded wine with aromas of chewing gum, cherry and blackberry. It's a plump, sort of grabby red with sweet raspberry and chocolate flavors followed by a creamy, soft finish. Not much complexity but good fruit and depth. Not the least bit hard to drink. Good mass wine.",85
Michael Schachner,Finca Las Moras 2007 Reserve Chardonnay (San Juan),"Not exactly a world-class white wine but at least it smells and tastes like Chardonnay. The nose offers some butter and lemon curd, while the palate is jumpy and tastes like a mix of pear, apple and spice. A fresh, young wine that should be drunk soon.",85
,Long Flat 2006 Destinations Sauvignon Blanc (Adelaide Hills),"Juicy and well balanced, this is an admirable effort at the price. Boxwood, grapefruit, lemon and quince notes make for a sophisticated first impression. The palate is straightforward citrus while gooseberry notes pop up on the dry finish. Drink now.",85
,Work 2004 Reserve Merlot (Sonoma Mountain),"Tasty, with pie-filling cherries, blackberries and currants accented with smoky oak, but a little on the soft side. Fully developed, so drink now.",85
Paul Gregutt,Amity 2006 Estate Single Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This seems as if it was assembled from lesser barrels. It's pleasant, very light, simple and tart; the dominant flavor is cranberry juice.",85
,Autumn Hill 2007 Petit Verdot-Merlot Red (Monticello),"Cherry pie-filling and boysenberry notes open this impressive blend of Merlot and Petit Verdot. Abundant but velvety tannins give a lift to blueberry and   chocolate tones in the mouth, while the slightly grippy finish shows appealing mixed berry flavors.",85
,Blue Rock 2005 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"Ripe, soft and a little sweet, with jellied flavors of blackberries, cherries, chocolate and anise. Drink now.",85
Paul Gregutt,Cherry Hill 2006 Papillon Estate Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Spicy and tannic, this inexpensive Pinot from Cherry Hill opens with earthy fruit and leaf flavors—tomato and herb dominate, with just a suggestion of berry. There isn't much in the way of ripeness here, to either fruit or tannins.",85
,Cloud 9 2006 Seity Zinfandel (Amador County),"Shows the briary, brambly character of Foothills Zin, with an array of wild berry, tobacco, mocha and Asian spice flavors wrapped into finely ground tannins. But the wine is too sweet and candied in the finish. Drink now.",85
Michael Schachner,Cueva de las Manos 2007 Reserve Malbec (Luján de Cuyo),"Huge in color and extract, but also a little childish. The nose has gumball, berry jam and a touch of volatility, but after things settle it rests on bold black fruit. It's not overly rich or sweet, and the feel is sort of sinewy. Seems more about size and color than refinement and polish.",85
,David Fulton 2008 Petite Sirah (St. Helena),"The winery has a good track record with this bottling, which shows how well Petite Sirah does in the warmer St. Helena appellation of Napa Valley. This '08 is dryish to moderately sweet in jammy blackberries and blueberries, with a smoked meat, bacon edge. But it's also firmly tannic, which provides a framework for the sweetness.",89
Virginie Boone,Esterlina 2009 Reserva Pinot Noir (Cole Ranch),"Esterlina's Pinot is very perfumey, light in body and soul at first, as it gathers steam with a tasty backbone of lush red fruit, spice and plenty of staying power over a meal.",89
Lauren Buzzeo,Goats do Roam Wine Co. 2008 Goat-Roti Syrah-Viognier (Coastal Region),"A good value, this is an easy-pleasing Syrah with vibrant notes of red plum, cherry and blueberry. Fine, dusty tannins reminiscent of cocoa powder and dried crushed berries stay after swallow alongside a hint of sweet smoke flavor.",89
Lauren Buzzeo,Graham Beck 2007 The William Red (Coastal Region),"This approachable Cabernet-based blend, which also has 18% Pinotage, 11% Cab Franc and 2% Shiraz, is a spicy and balanced red with notes of menthol, purple florals, black cherry and berry. With a mouthfeel like crushed velvet, a black pepper finish and an attractive price tag, it's a shame only 100 cases were produced.",89
Lauren Buzzeo,Hartenberg 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Stellenbosch),"This wine strikes a superb balance between herbaceous, green notes and ripe black fruit, all graced with a kiss of sweet vanilla. Rich blackberry and cassis flavors flood the palate, but then transition to sweet smoke and oak flavors on the finish.",89
Roger Voss,Vignobles 46N118 2007 Noir 46 Malbec (Cahors),"Tannic yet balanced wine with a great swathe of perfumed fruit as well as dense black flavors. There is a herbal character as well as dark plum and sweet fruit flavors. Age for 2–3 years, the wine will always be firm.",89
Paul Gregutt,Willamette Valley Vineyards 2009 Estate Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Young, tart and wrapped up tight as a drum, this offers sharp flavors of cranberry and a bit of Campari. It has the heft and polish to open up further with some additional bottle age, but it isn't budging at the moment.",89
Michael Schachner,Algodon 2008 Estate Blend Gran Reserva Red,"A blend of 50% Malbec with Cabernet, Syrah and Merlot that's lightly minty and full of tobacco, pepper and spicy aromas. Feels a bit clampy and tannic, with oaky, herbal flavors of plum and sweet berry. Shows a hint of green and drying tannins on the finish.",89
Virginie Boone,Beaver Creek 2008 Fairytale Red (Napa Valley),"Beaver Creek makes a variation of Fairytale every vintage and this one, sourced from Napa Valley, is 41% Merlot, 36% Zinfandel and 23% Syrah, a mix that seems to work very nicely here. The wine's Zin almost tastes as if it has mountain tannins; the wine is overall herbal and earthy, ripe and sturdy with balanced fruit.",89
,Byron 2009 Monument Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"A very good Pinot Noir, rich in cherry, licorice, cola and spice flavors that are wrapped into firm tannins. It's on the forward side, trading complexity and nuance in favor of immediate gratification. Drink now–2014.",89
Lauren Buzzeo,Jardin 2007 Syrah (Stellenbosch),"A good amount of earthy spice, tea leaves and forrest floor lead the way on the nose, but the black cherry and berry fruit aromas follow shortly after with an additional accent of sweet cured meat. Medium weight and lush, the creamy mouth transitions into a finish loaded with sweet spice and bittersweet cocoa.",89
Lauren Buzzeo,Jardin 2009 Nine Yards Chardonnay (Stellenbosch),"Fairly intense and flavorful, this Chard expresses assertive aromas and flavors of wood-grilled peaches, buttercream frosting, lemon custard and toasted brioche. Medium weight in the mouth with good balance and a touch of baking spice on the close.",89
Michael Schachner,Kaiken 2008 Corte Malbec-Bonarda-Petit Verdot Red (Mendoza),"For an under-$15 red blend, Corte has it going on. It's rich and full, almost syrupy on the nose, with lots of oak, ink and vanilla. Shows power and packs a punch, with dark berry, chocolate and spicy flavors. A little tannic and scratchy, but with structure and framework to spare. Malbec (80%), with Bonarda and Petit Verdot.",89
,Lungarotti 2007 Torre di Giano Vigna il Pino White (Torgiano),"This vineyard-designate blend of Trebbiano and Grechetto opens with a luminous golden color and elegant aromas of stone fruit, citrus, Golden Delicious apple and mature pear. There's a pretty hint of vanilla and almond butter at the back.",89
,Marchesi Fumanelli 2005 Terso White (Veneto),"This sophisticated white wine from the homeland of Italy's most robust reds (Ripasso and Amarone) shows a full, generous appearance with a golden-amber color. Stone fruit, toasted almond and candied lemon give it heft and consistency.",89
Roger Voss,Mariell 2009 Blaufränkisch (Leithaberg),"Smooth and ripe, this is a rich black-fruited wine, its tannins comfortably ensconsed in a rich cushion. There is acidity to balance and spice which, along with the full-bodied fruit character, makes the wine ready to drink now.",89
,Livio Felluga 2009 Friulano (Colli Orientali del Friuli),"A gorgeous expression of Friulano, this wine (in a screwcap bottle) makes an elegant addition to chicken, pasta or seafood dinners. Layers of peach, almond and pineapple are wrapped tightly together.",89
Susan Kostrzewa,My Big Fat Greek Wine 2010 Assyrtico (Santorini),"Lively aromas of lemon, grapefruit and melon start this white from Greece. Flavors of grapefruit and lemon rind are fresh and crisp but still offer dimension. The finish is spicy and clean. A great food wine: pair with grilled fish or clams.",89
,Nals Margreid 2010 Sirmian Pinot Bianco (Alto Adige),"This partially oak-aged expression of Pinot Bianco from cool-climate Alto Adige (in the far north of Italy) offers a lovely texture that is creamy and smooth at the same time. Measured aromas include melon, apricot, grapefruit and a touch of vanilla spice.",89
Michael Schachner,O. Fournier 2007 B Crux Red (Uco Valley),"Leather, berry, earth, raisin and roasted qualities define the nose on this Tempranillo-led blend of four grapes. Feels good in the mouth, with active raspberry, plum and coffee flavors that comes with a roasted accent. Mildly leafy, baked and woody on the thorough finish.",89
,Pico Maccario 2010 Estrosa White (Monferrato),"This is a gorgeous Italian white from northern Italy that boasts fragrant tones of spring flower and chopped herb backed by peach, honey and white almond. It's crisp, intense and would be perfect with basil Thai curry.",89
Michael Schachner,Sottano 2009 Reserva de Familia Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),"A medium-weight Cabernet with plum, prune, tobacco and herb aromas. Features average weight and body, with a creamy texture and layered flavors of black fruit, raspberry and spice. Finishes with herb and plum notes as well as a pinch of tobacco.",89
,St. Francis 2009 Old Vines Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"A huge, kick butt Zinfandel, packed with sweet berry, bacon, black pepper and smoky cedar flavors. There's absolutely nothing shy about it. Packs a real punch all the way through to the spicy finish. Good price for a Sonoma Zin this classic.",89
,Trailhead 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Quite a good Cabernet, showing the elegance and ripe fruitiness you expect from Napa, in a style for drinking now. Drily tannic, it shows classic blackberry and blueberry flavors.",89
Paul Gregutt,Erath 2009 Bishop Creek Pinot Noir,"Fruity, forward and quite refreshing, this has appealing black cherry fruit with a light candy flavor. The balancing tannins add sufficient depth and weight to allow this a few more years in the cellar.",89
,Franz Haas 2009 Sauvignon (Alto Adige),"This oak-fermented Sauvignon (in an artsy, screwcap bottle) delivers a rich, spicy finish and thick layers of peach, citrus, tomato leaf and honey-like aromas. It's a gorgeous wine that is an absolute pleasure to drink.",89
Roger Voss,Forstreiter 2012 Schiefer Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal),"A strongly spicy, rich wine, this has great concentration and an intense, dense texture.There is weight with plenty of ripe tropical fruits to contrast pronounced black pepper and bitter almond character. It's still young, so don't drink before 2015. Screwcap.",92
,Cambria 2011 Bench Break Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"This is another fine Pinot from Cambria, showing the winery's great price-quality ratio. Words like opulent and elegant come to mind to describe intense flavors of black cherries, licorice, cola, herb tea and Indian spices. It's bone dry, and also quite tannic, but you can enjoy it now with big, rich lamb and beef dishes, or a wild mushroom risotto. Otherwise, it will continue to improve for at least eight years.",92
Kerin O’Keefe,I Giusti e Zanza 2009 Dulcamara Red (Toscana),"This delicious blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot opens with an intense, brooding fragrance of dark fruit, spice and leather. The palate delivers a concentrated black-cherry flavor that's framed by big, chewy tannins and  punctuated by spicy accents of white and black pepper, licorice and pipe. Drink 2015–2024.",92
Paul Gregutt,J. Christopher 2011 Bella Vida Vineyard Unfiltered Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Bella Vida replaces the Abbey Ridge bottling and does so with pizzazz. The best of the 2011 releases, this is a beautiful expression of grapes grown on red clay soils, with refined, deeply penetrating flavors of ripe raspberries. Smooth, supple and long, with uncommon purity, it finishes with a kiss of chocolate from 18 months in one-quarter new oak barrels.",92
Michael Schachner,Viña Cobos 2011 Marchiori Vineyard Block C2 Malbec (Perdriel),"This huge Malbec defines jammy and concentrated. The bouquet is ripe, soft and minty, while the palate echoes the nose with thickness and density. Flavors of prune, raisin, tea and blackberry are borderline syrupy, while the finish is smooth and pure but doesn't offer much spine or foundation. Drink this modern Malbec sooner rather than later.",92
Roger Voss,Salomon-Undhof 2011 Steiner Kögl Erste Lage Riesling (Kremstal),"This is a very aromatic wine that's rich, spicy and with just a touch of ripeness. It has spiced pear, lychee and honey notes all balanced by a wonderful fresh acidity. Drink now and until 2020. Screwcap.",92
,Talley 2011 Rincon Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley),"While delicious now with flavors of raspberries, cherries, cola and oak, all showered with tart, citrusy acidity, this wine also has a great future. Give it 6–8 years to evolve in the bottle for further complexity.",92
Michael Schachner,Acústic 2010 Braó Vinyes Velles Carignan-Grenache (Montsant),"This is the stud in the Acústic stable. A blend of 70% Carignan and 30% Garnacha, Braó is lively and bright on the nose, with ripe blackberry and cassis aromas. The palate is concentrated and juicy, with fine balance and bold flavors of blueberry, blackberry and coffee. A toasty, dark finish features chocolate, toast and minerality. Drink through 2019.",92
Roger Voss,Josef Schmid 2011 Kremser Gebling Erste Lage Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal),"While it feels rich and round, this is also a wine with a crisp side to it. Acidity cuts through ripe pear, apricot and lychee flavors, giving a decidedly crisp balance. It's a wine that is already ready to drink. Screwcap.",92
,Parallel 2010 Fortune Teller Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon is so rich and decadent, with milk chocolate, blackberry and new French oak flavors. Made by celebrity winemaker Philippe Melka, it's soft and approacheable on the palate and widely appealing. Your best bet is to drink up now.",92
Roger Voss,Château Lafon-Rochet 2011  Saint-Estèphe,"This is a wine that has great potential—you can tell from the firm tannins, tight acidity and closed texture. Initially, black currant flavors are touched with dark, dusty notes, but they finish with more juicy character on the afterntaste. Drink from 2017.",92
Kerin O’Keefe,Dionigi 2006  Sagrantino di Montefalco,"This powerful Sagrantino opens with aromas of meat juice, truffle and black fruit. The palate offers blackberry, black cherry, cinnamon and black pepper, along with tobacco notes. It also has Sagrantino's trademark tannic backbone, but the tannins are ripe and are balanced by bright acidity.",92
Roger Voss,Domaine Daniel Dugois 2006 Vin Jaune Savagnin (Arbois),"Rich almonds, ripe peaches and a smoky, oxidized character all come together in this ripe, complex, fascinating wine. There is a great tang of apple acidity on the finish. Drink now.",92
Joe Czerwinski,Kilikanoon 2009 Green's Vineyard Shiraz (Barossa Valley),"This wine displays ample concentration in its inky color and potent aromas of dark berry fruit. There's a hint of raisining as well. In the mouth, it's mouthfilling but lacks a bit of texture; the flavors include dark plums, vanilla and hints of dried fruits, like figs and dates. With a finish that calls to mind chocolate fudge (minus the sugar), opt for drinking this wine over the relatively near term, now to 2020.",92
Michael Schachner,Finca Sophenia 2011 Synthesis Malbec (Tupungato),"Deep, lush aromas of black fruits, graphite and coconut are welcoming and friendly. The mouthfeel is pure and smooth, with elegance and power. Flavors of cassis, blackberry, hard spices and licorice filter into a long, mellow, classy finish. This is a pushy, full-bodied wine that doesn't throw punches; drink through 2020.",92

Michael Schachner,Ventisquero 2008 Grey [Glacier] Single Block Trinidad Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),"Rooty and leafy on the nose, with red berry aromas peeking through some obvious oak. The palate offers cherry and raspberry flavors along with sweetness, and things are backed by vanilla and chocolate. Good, tasty and oaky, with proper layering.",87
,Aquinas 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is a soft, gentle Cabernet for drinking now. It's pleasantly rich, offering blackberry, cherry, chocolate and cedar flavors, wrapped into easy tannins.",87
Michael Schachner,Arboleda 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Aconcagua Valley),"Foresty and dark on the bouquet, with aromas of licorice, prune, forest and foxiness. The palate is full and tannic, while flavors run sweet, creamy and slightly syrupy, with chocolate and spiced fig notes. Finishes rich and rough, with dry herbs and true Chilean Cab flavors of olive and oregano.",87
,Attilio Ghisolfi 2007 Pinay Red (Langhe),"Pinay is a tight and defined red blend from northern Italy with bright accents of cherry cola, forest berry, licorice and dark mineral. There's a sharp, sour note on the close that would pair with smoked cheese.",87
,Benessere 2007 Estate Sangiovese (Napa Valley),"Soft, light in body and easy to drink, this Sangiovese, from the Napa estate vineyard, is delicious in raspberry, red currant, licorice, bacon and spice flavors. It's somewhat ephemeral, an instantly pleasant wine to drink especially with cured meats, olives, hard cheeses.",87
Paul Gregutt,Buried Cane 2009 Whiteline No Oak Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A good, clean, tart and lightly spicy all-stainless style. Cool climate fruit puts the accent on lime and lemon flavors, keeps the alcohol low (13.3%), and makes this a fine match to shellfish, white fish and light pasta dishes.",87
,Cantina del Nebbiolo 2008  Roero,"This fresh Nebbiolo-based Roero from Cantina dei Nebbiolo offers pretty intensity with aromas of tar, licorice and a touch of sweet cherry liqueur. There isn't much pulp or meat here but the finish is both crisp and tart.",87
,Cascina Adelaide 2005 4 Vigne  (Barolo),"Slightly disjointed at first, this Barolo with fruit sourced from four vineyard sites, needs a few minutes to open in the glass. The wine offers tertiary aromas of cured beef, smoked bacon and white mushroom. Drink now.",87
,Cascina La Ghersa 2004 Vignassa  (Barbera d'Asti Superiore Nizza),This aged expression from the Nizza subzone of Asti offers tertiary aromas of dried tobacco and dried prune. The variety's characteristic acidity kicks in on the finish.,87
Virginie Boone,Claudia Springs 2007 Zinfandel (Mendocino County),"Muted at first, this wine opens up nicely with time. Sweet, ripe and easy on the finish, its core is full of black pepper and clove. The grapes are sourced from several distinctive vineyards in Mendocino County. Drink it with a steak.",87
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Cramele Recas 2009 Chardonnay (Recas),"Fragrant on the nose with fresh orange, lemon and honeysuckle aromas, this full-bodied Chard is deliciously quaffable with a concentrated apple palate and just a hint of buttered toast. Another well-made Romanian at an unbeatable bargain price.",87
Roger Voss,Domaine Bertagna 2009 Les Dames Huguettes  (Côte de Nuits-Villages),"Rich and full in the mouth, packed with red fruits and black cherries. The wine is sweet, while keeping a tannic core. Drink next year.",87
Susan Kostrzewa,Domaine Sigalas 2010 Asirtiko Athiri White (Santorini),"This fuller-bodied white blend offers pineapple, kiwi and citrus on the nose, and a blend of full fruit and acidity on the palate. A balanced, easygoing white that is perfect for everyday poultry, vegetable and fish meals.",87
,Socré 2006 Nebbiolo (Langhe),Here's a fun and slightly less formal expression of Nebbiolo (especially when compared to the great wines of Barbaresco and Barolo) that offers tight fruit nuances of white cherry and forest berry backed by light shadings of spice and smoke.,87
,Boffa 2006 Nebbiolo (Langhe),"Aged 12 months in large oak casks, this bright Nebbiolo offers pretty aromas of small berry, tar, licorice and cigar smoke backed by tight intensity and structure. Pair this powerful wine with braised quail or pork tenderloin.",87
Joe Czerwinski,Otto's Constant Dream 2008 Syrah (Hawke's Bay),"This wine is light in color, but still packs a mouthful of flavor. It's peppery and meaty upfront, filled out on the midpalate by tart fruit that verges on cranberry in flavor. Pretty rather than potent; drink now-2014.",87
,Mount Veeder 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A good wine to drink now for its sweet, ripe berry and mocha flavors and smoky coat of oak. It has smooth tannins and a spicy finish. Give it a good decant to let it breathe for a few hours.",87
,Rabino 2008  Roero,"Roero Rabino is accented by sweet touches of cinnamon and nutmeg that are offset by cassis, dried blueberry, leather and tobacco. This sturdy red wine presents a very nice ensemble that is capped by a tight, astringent close.",87
,Robert Mondavi 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"With rich, sweet blackberry and cocoa flavors, this is a very nice Cabernet for drinking with a good meal. It's a little rough around the edges, with jaggy tannins. Ready now.",87
,Bellussi NV Extra Dry  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene),"Honey, almond blossom and citrus zest are followed by creamy foam and tonic acidity. This is an easygoing Prosecco that offers a light and compact structure and bright flavors of lime and green fruit.",86
Roger Voss,Château Mont-Pérat 2008 Les Amants Mont-Pérat  (Bordeaux Blanc),"An intriguing blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Muscadelle, which highlights the herbaceous Sauvignon character and a more perfumed Muscadelle. The two give a fresh, citrus- and pineapple-flavored wine, lively, to be enjoyed young.",86
Roger Voss,Château Tour de Mirambeau 2006  Bordeaux Blanc,"Soft, ripe, dominated by peaches, pears and a rounded, toasty character. The spice is dominant, giving the wine an exotic edge. The more rounded style gives concentration as well as a fine, finishing velvet texture.",86
Michael Schachner,Aresti 2007 Reserva Merlot (Curicó Valley),"Fiery and wild at first, with aromas of cinnamon, pepper and Juicy Fruit gum. Strange as that may sound, the wine finds a more familiar place on the palate, where plum, cherry and cassis flavors are flashy and the feel is a bit clangy. Rounds out with air and settles down fairly nicely.",86
,Paladin 2007 Millesimato Brut Prosecco (Veneto),"Paladin produces a luminous and fresh Prosecco from the northeast of Italy with tonic aromas of peach, white stone and citrus fruit. It's an easy-drinking wine that would wash down well with appetizers and informal finger foods.",86
,Perlage 2008 Col di Manza Extra Dry Millesimato  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene),Soapy aromas of bee's wax and lavender open the nose of this luminous sparkler and are followed by dried flowers and hay. There are peach-like flavors with aftertastes of green melon and lime. Grapes are grown organically and according to biodynamic principles.,86
,Sant Eurosia 2007 Brut  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene),This Brut interpretation of Prosecco (“Brut” means it tastes dry in the mouth) offers tangy fizz and soda-like intensity backed by subdued aromas of white mineral and stone fruit. Pair it with puff pastry appetizers.,86
,Sant Eurosia 2007 Millesimato Dry  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene),"This is a “dry” vintage Prosecco with a hint of sweetness in the mouth that is surrounded by fragrant flavors of peach, kiwi and green melon. This luminous sparkler tastes firm and tonic and makes for an informal afternoon sipper.",86
Michael Schachner,J. & F. Lurton 2006 Gran Araucano Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley),"Mildly minty and woody on the nose, with grass, wintergreen and cheese aromas as well as red fruit. The palate is tight and grabby, with a blast of citric acid that gives the plum and raspberry flavors a tart, decidedly “red” personality. Snappy and crisp on the finish, making it a fresh, lean style of Cabernet.",86
,L'Antica Quercia 2007 Matiú Brut  (Prosecco di Conegliano),The wine's golden hue tells you this is Prosecco from a warmer climate (Conegliano is a few degrees warmer than Valdobbiadene) as do its aromas of mature peach and honeysuckle. The wine tastes flat and big in the mouth and offers sophisticated notes of white pepper and spice.,86
Susan Kostrzewa,Lucas Vineyards 2007 Vignoles (Finger Lakes),"This white has a light, delicate nose of citrus and apricot. On the palate it's smooth and balanced with lush apricot and spice flavors. A touch of acidity gives the wine lift. A lingering finish adds to its poise. Pair with a creamy cheese or sip alone.",86
,Marsuret NV Extra Dry  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene),Drying mineral tones face off with luscious peach flavors to create a well-balanced Extra Dry Prosecco sparkler. The bubbly offers cheerful foaming in the mouth and sweet fruit flavors on the close.,86
Michael Schachner,De Martino 2007 Legado Reserva Chardonnay (Limarí Valley),"Opening aromas of vanilla cookie show a resemblance to Animal Crackers, while the palate is more vivacious and tangy, with flavors of orange, tangerine and apple. We wouldn't call this an elegant or refined wine, but we like its no-issues attitude and citrusy content. Probably good with salads and seafood.",86
,Beringer 2007 Alluvium Blanc White (Knights Valley),"This New World blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Sémillon, Chardonnay and Viognier is very fruity. It offers a blast of pineapples, honeysuckles, peaches and figs, with a coating of oaky, vanilla buttercream.",86
,Brutocao 2006 Reserve Zinfandel (Mendocino),"With a fruity-sugary finish, this Zin will appeal to folks who like their red wines a little on the sweet side. It has pleasantly ripe flavors of black cherries, raspberries, red currants, root beer, mocha and pepper.",86
,Clos La Chance 2006 Lila's Cuvée Red (Central Coast),"This Rhône-style blend is a little rustic and sharp in tannins and acids. It shows a polished core of jammy blackberries, cherries and spices, and could develop in a year or two.",86
Michael Schachner,Cono Sur 2008 Visión Gewürztraminer (Casablanca Valley),"Frosted aromas of orange creamsicle, lychee and melon give this an elevated, unique sort of bouquet. Among Chilean Gewürztraminers, this is one of the more expressive ones you'll find. Pineapple, mango and other tropical flavors are pleasant, while the feel is forward and fun. Drink this summer with fish and salads.",86
,Sommariva NV Palazzo Rosso Brut  (Prosecco di Conegliano),"This Prosecco Brut from the slightly warmer Conegliano subzone is a perfect example of its kind. The luminous sparkler offers drying mineral tones that are embellished by pretty notes of white rose, honey, stone fruit and citrus. The mouthfeel is lean, smooth and fresh.",86
,Spagnol NV Col del Sas Extra Dry  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene),This crisp sparkler is characterized by drying mineral tones and delicate aromas of stone fruit and citrus. The wine is foamy and slightly sweet in the mouth and does an excellent job of representing this category of Italian wine.,86
Roger Voss,Jacquart NV Mosaïque Rosé Brut  (Champagne),"A ripe, fruity wine that takes its raspberry flavor from the color. The wine has softness, a creamy character that rounds out any acidity, leaving a smooth, fruity finish.",86
,L'Antica Quercia 2007 Arió Extra Dry  (Prosecco di Conegliano),"There's a unique note here of mature fruit, chopped basil or peppermint with a hint of spice or chopped white peppercorn. The bubbling seems less frothy and the wine has a flat, big feel in the mouth. Grapes were farmed organically and the wine is from the 2007 vintage, which may explain its distinctive style.",86
Michael Schachner,Koyle 2015 Costa Pinot Noir (Colchagua Costa),"Gritty, heavily roasted aromas of peanuts and herbal berry fruits lead to a scratchy, tannic palate. This tastes of burnt oak, raw plum and currant, while the finish tastes briny and harsh. The 2012 version of this wine was much better. This is rough from front to back.",83
Lauren Buzzeo,Château Notre Dame du Quatourze 2015 Rosé (Languedoc),"An easy and inviting selection, there's a mentholated streak to the soft red currant and cherry core of this wine. Light and breezy on the palate, it offers thin, quickly dissipating flavors and a fleeting finish.",83
Roger Voss,Mémoires 2015 Rosé (Coteaux Varois en Provence),The wine is earthy and somewhat rustic. There is fruit but it is spoiled by a spicy pepper edge. Chill this drastically.,82
Michael Schachner,Cavas Hill NV 1887 Rosado Sparkling (Cava),"Red in color, with berry and apple aromas, this is sweet, with a heavy body and light effervescence.",82
Anne Krebiehl MW,Antoine Moltès & Fils 2015 Tradition Pinot Gris (Alsace),"The nose is muted, despite the slight spritz of the wine, while the palate is equally toned down. It's a rounded if not very expressive white wine.",82
Virginie Boone,Pezzi King 2013 Serracino Reserve Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Plummy and hinting at black cherry, this wine is otherwise soft and simple, with a distracting, full-throttled descent into raisin cake and prune.",82
Michael Schachner,Bellisco NV Sparkling (Cava),"Funky, yeasty aromas of cinnamon, spent lees and bread yeast dominate the nose. This feels foamy, with lightly vegetal flavors of apple that finish briny.",82
Michael Schachner,Pura 8 2010 Grand Reserve Pinot Noir (Rapel Valley),"Jumpy on the nose at first, but then green tea and grassy aromas take over. This PN is what it is: it tastes grassy, leafy and like green beans. Vegetal notes carry over to the finish.",81
Michael Schachner,Viña Tarapacá 2015 Gran Reserva Chardonnay (Leyda Valley),"Aromas of pumpkin, squash and corn chips are stale and not inviting. There's an acceptable mouthfeel to this weird, unbalanced Chardonnay along with flavors of spiced squash, mealy apple and sautéed root vegetables.",80
Joe Czerwinski,Chambers Rosewood Vineyards NV Rare Muscat (Rutherglen),"This wine contains some material over 100 years old, but shows no signs of fragility. Instead, it's concentrated through age and should hold in the bottle indefinitely. It's dark coffee-brown in color, with delectable aromas of rancio, dried fig, molasses and black tea, yet despite enormous concentration avoids excessive weight. And it's amazingly complex and fresh on the nearly endless finish.",100
Joe Czerwinski,Chambers Rosewood Vineyards NV Rare Muscadelle (Rutherglen),"This deep brown wine smells like a damp, mossy cave. Then add complex rancio notes, plus maple syrup and molasses. It's full, round and harmonious, wonderfully rich yet without any sense of heaviness and long and bright on the finish.",98
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Robert Weil 2014 Kiedrich Gräfenberg Trockenbeerenauslese Riesling (Rheingau),"Dusty, saffron-spiced earthiness is juxtaposed against intense mango and tangerine fruitiness in this deeply complex wine. It's unctuously sweet, but balanced by a piercing streak of acidity that penetrates through the midpalate. Spry and silken, it finishes on a long lingering whisper of honey and peach.",97
Joe Czerwinski,Chambers Rosewood Vineyards NV Grand Muscat (Rutherglen),"Deep mahogany. Dried fig and black tea on the nose, then concentrated mocha and molasses flavors, enlivened by candied orange zest. Full, rich and sweet, but surprisingly drinkable, with terrific intensity and length.",97
Joe Czerwinski,Torbreck 2012 RunRig Shiraz-Viognier (Barossa),"RunRig is always complex, and the 2012 doesn't disappoint in that regard, mixing bacony-meaty notes with hints of black olives and ripe plums. The tannins are supremely supple, but the acids are crisp, resulting in a long, mouthwatering finish. Drink now–2030.",97
Kerin O’Keefe,Cavallotto 2010 Vignolo Riserva  (Barolo),"After a few minutes in the glass, this stunning wine opens up to reveal classic Nebbiolo aromas of leather, tilled soil, underbrush, fragrant blue flower and ripe berry. The juicy concentrated palate dishes out layers of succulent black cherry, crushed raspberry, anise and pipe tobacco framed in firm, velvety tannins. Drink 2022–2035.",97
Jeff Jenssen,Oremus 2005 Eszencia  (Tokaji),"This amber-colored Hungarian stunner has ethereal aromas of raw honey, beeswax, freshly baked tarte Tatin, canned apricot and fresh pear. It is silky smooth and creamy in the mouth with pronounced flavors of clover honey, pear tart and baked sweet apples. The acidity is perfectly balanced so you can appreciate its velvety richness without feeling that the sweetness is too cloying.",96
Virginie Boone,Rochioli 2014 South River Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Citrus-kissed saltiness lies at the core of this incredibly delicious, deliriously crafted wine, from the great grape grower in the heart of the Russian River Valley. Beautifully crisp, it lingers in stony minerality and a freshness of apricot, memorable from first sip to last.",96
Roger Voss,Louis Latour 2014 Le Montrachet  (Montrachet),"This beautiful, rich wine has yellow fruits and is concentrated, tightly textured and conveys a ripe character. The touches of wood are just right, adding spice to the opulent fruitiness. A mineral texture gives some tightness to the aftertaste. Drink from 2024.",96
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Robert Weil 2014 Kiedrich Gräfenberg Beerenauslese Riesling (Rheingau),"Whiffs of white mushroom, saffron and caramel lend complexity to this concentrated elixir of apricots and orange peels. It's honeyed and sweet but vivaciously balanced, glazing the palate in ethereal textures of gossamer and tulle. The caramel finish lingers endlessly.",96
Virginie Boone,Rochioli 2014 Sweetwater Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"A waft of smoky char and toasty oak provide a rich foundation and compelling entry into this one-acre vineyard-designate from the historic grower, before unleashing, slowly, a torrent of melon and fresh-cut apple with a length of intriguing nutmeg and cardamom. Medium-bodied and lush, it will remain on your palate memory a long time.",96
Joe Czerwinski,Jasper Hill 2013 Georgia's Paddock Shiraz (Heathcote),"Dusty, firm, powerful: just a few apt descriptors for this vintage of one of Heathcote's top wines. Mocha, licorice and blackberries feature on the nose, while the palate delivers more of the same—dark fruit, chocolate and plenty of spice. Best after 2020.",95
Roger Voss,Château de la Tour 2013 Vieilles Vignes  (Clos de Vougeot),"Produced from vines more than 100 years old in the heart of the Clos de Vougeot vineyard, this is an impressive wine with a long future. The wood aging is already surrounded by ripe, intense black fruits. A fresher character comes from the bright acidity of the vintage, giving the wine a lift. The aftertaste is long and concentrated. Drink from 2024.",95
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Weingut Hans Bausch 2011 Hattenheimer Hassel Auslese Riesling (Rheingau),"Intensely fragrant, this honey-sweet auslese wafts of ripe yellow peaches and caramelized sugar. Tropical mango, pineapple and melon collide on the palate before falling neatly in line against a strike of high-toned acidity. The finish is luxuriously long, peppered by a faint dusting of saffron. It's a stunner already but should shine brightly for decades to come.",95
Roger Voss,Philippe Colin 2014 Les Chenevottes Premier Cru  (Chassagne-Montrachet),"Up the slope above the Grand Cru of Le Montrachet, this vineyard once grew hemp (hence the name, cheneve). This poised wine is both stylish and rich, with good acidity allied to ripe apple and citrus fruits, cut through the mineral texture and promise a generous wine as it ages. Drink from 2020.",95
Joe Czerwinski,Torbreck 2012 Descendant Shiraz-Viognier (Barossa Valley),"Bacon and tapenade elements merge easily on the nose, followed by a wine that's full bodied and creamy textured on the palate. This is dark and meaty in profile, yet not heavy or cooked, with a long, harmonious finish. Drink now–2030.",95
Kerin O’Keefe,Bel Colle 2012 Simposio  (Barolo),"Enticing scents of ripe berry, underbrush, grilled herb and eucalyptus mingle together along with an underlying fragrance of rose petal. Elegant and fresh, the impeccably balanced palate delivers tart red cherry, cake spice, white pepper and mineral nuances alongside polished tannins. Drink 2018–2028.",95
Virginie Boone,J. Davies 2012 Jamie Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),"As impressive as the woman—a pioneer in the Napa Valley—was herself, this 100% varietal wine from the estate property high atop Diamond Mountain is powerfully elegant, intense yet refined. It begins with a high-toned, graceful entry that's rich in blueberry and chocolate, the oak smooth and integrated, with a suggestion of hand-rolled tobacco. Drink now through 2022.",95
Roger Voss,Louis Latour 2014  Criots-Bâtard-Montrachet,"This is an opulent wine from one of the fabled series of white Grand Crus. Along with generous yellow fruits and ripe citrus, it has weight and gravitas. Spice from the wood fills things out even more, giving the wine its balance, its intensity and its future. Drink from 2022.",95
Paul Gregutt,Winderlea 2014 Weber Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"For 2014, the Weber is the star of a very fine Winderlea lineup. Dark and deeply concentrated, it's jammed with black cherry fruit, annotated with anise and showing a hint of gunmetal. The tannins are ripe and taste of clean earth. This is a fine candidate for aging. Drink now through 2030.",95
Joe Czerwinski,Wakefield 2013 St. Andrews Single Vineyard Release Shiraz (Clare Valley),"The Taylor family selected Clare Valley for its Cabernet affinity, but this Shiraz is a knockout. Yes, it's oaky—full of menthol, vanilla and toasted coconut—but there's just enough black cherry and plum fruit to support the wood. It's a plush, full-bodied wine with immense appeal, for drinking now–2025.",95
Joe Czerwinski,Cantina Terlano 2000 Vorberg Pinot Bianco (Alto Adige),"This spends 12 months in oak and it shows: It offers aromas of liquid smoke and flavors of brown sugar, honey and caramel. The fruit is subdued, leaving the emphasis on the oak and mineral components. Try with rich but delicately flavored fish dishes or mild chèvres.",88
Michael Schachner,De Martino 1999 Reserva de la Familia Carmenère (Maipo Valley),"Aromas of mint, berry syrup and dense, lemony oak lay a good foundation for the heavy black fruit that comes on the palate atop a plush carpet of toasty, fresh-grained wood. The finish is round, tasty and mouthfilling, while overall the wine seems to dance due to popping acidity. This is Carmenère with a vital streak.",88
Joe Czerwinski,Montresor 2001  Bianco di Custoza,"A plump, juicy mouthful of citrusy fruit, worth trying with grilled or broiled seafood. The zesty lime aromas broaden out on the palate to include orange and tangerine flavors, making it tart but not too tart. Best Buy.",88
Joe Czerwinski,Ronco del Gelso 1999 Chardonnay (Friuli),"This medium-weight wine flows effortlessly from start to finish, blending aromas of smoke and nuts with a citrusy core. Picks up savory nutty, cheesy notes (like a good Gruyère) on the long finish.",88
,Sebastiani 1991 Cherryblock Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),"Mint again, with earth and tobacco; one taster found traces of bell pepper. Coffee and brown sugar further soften a supple, mature mouthfeel. Drink now.",88
Roger Voss,Elena Walch 2002 Castel Ringberg Sauvignon Blanc (Alto Adige),"Fragrant, aromatic, grassy aromas give way to fresh, crisp, green fruit and gooseberry flavors. Finishes lively and vibrant.",88
Roger Voss,Gini 2002 Classico  (Soave),"A fresh, crisp style of Soave, brimming with green plum and light acidity. It has concentration and a light touch in equal measure.",88
Roger Voss,Borgo Conventi 2002 I Fiori del Borgo Sauvignon Blanc (Collio),"Crisp, green, grassy wine with fresh acidity and herbeceous character. It is very New World with its tropical flavors and open, forward fruit.",88
,Ceago Vinegarden 2001 Kathleen's Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Mendocino County),"An irresistibly drinkable white wine, filled with the juiciest flavors of citrus fruits, fig, melon and peach, and just the tiniest bit sweet. Crisp acidity cleanses the palate and leaves it feeling minty fresh on the long, spicy finish.",88
,Valiano 1997 Vino in Musica Sangiovese (Toscana),"A soft, ripe wine that manages to showcase tobacco, earth and black cherry flavors in a relatively lightweight format, finishing long and tart.",88
Roger Voss,Volpe Pasini 2002 Zuc de Volpe Pinot Grigio (Colli Orientali del Friuli),"A well-judged, well-structured wine that balances fresh, crisp and light fruit against flavors of peaches, almonds and cinnamon. It will be better in two or three years' time.",88
Roger Voss,Zenato 2001 Vigneto Massoni White (Naoussa),"A fresh, tangy, vibrant wine that has ripe green plum and apple flavors alongside a layer of full, forward fruit.",88
,L.A. Cetto 1996 Private Reserve Nebbiolo (Valle de Guadalupe),"The color is appropriately light, the aromas appropriately floral and rose-like. Fleshy cherry flavors are balanced by a helping of greens and flowers. Light and elegant. Who would've thought Nebbiolo like this could come from Mexico?",88
Joe Czerwinski,La Vis 2001 Bianco dei Sorni White (Trentino),"This blend of Chardonnay, Nosiola and Pinot Bianco offers up apples and cream on the nose, along with flavors of peach and citrus. It's a comfortable mix of fruit that finishes lively and fresh, making it a fine apéritif.",88
Michael Schachner,Lapostolle 2002 Estate Bottled Merlot (Rapel Valley),"At first this is aggressive, with an aromatic note of wet dog along with blueberries. But soon it finds its legs and opens to display chocolate, espresso and a big batch of black plum and blackberry. The finish has full tannins and some coffee-like flavor. Currently it's wall-to-wall big, but it should settle down in no time and become a good red to drink on any occasion.",88
Joe Czerwinski,Fratelli Zeni 2000 Vigne Alte  (Bianco di Custoza),It's testament to this wine's balance that it remains so alive and fresh long after many other Biancos have faded. Intensely mineral aromas mix with notes of smoke and fresh apples; the flavors are earthy and hint at mineral oil. Long on the finish. Best Buy.,88
Michael Schachner,Carmen 2000 Estate Grown Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),"With its herbal, traditional aromas, this New World Cabernet could impersonate and Old World model. The palate is tight and firm, with lively tannins and bracing acids. The flavors run toward plum and chocolate, and there's a bitter hint on the back palate. The finish is plummy and dark.",88
Joe Czerwinski,Tommasi 2001 Vigneto Santa Cecilia Chardonnay (Valdadige),"This lovely Chardonnay has just the right blend of juicy peaches and subtle herbs and flowers to make it easy to drink, yet interesting enough to hold your attention. Finishes long and mouthwatering.",88
Roger Voss,San Michele Eppan 2002 Sanct Valentin Gewürztraminer (Alto Adige),"Aromas of roses, pepper and spices make this an enticing wine. On the palate, it is ripe, soft, full-bodied and rich, lacking acidity, but otherwise classic Gewürztraminer.",88
,Vinoce 2001 Sauvignon Blanc (Rutherford),"Richly textured, viscous but with good acidty for balance. The wine shows pretty melon, citrus, herb, grass, peach and spice flavors and features a mineral edge that is fresh and clean at the end.",88
,Merriam 2000 Windacre Vineyard Merlot (Russian River Valley),"A first-rate wine, with well-ripened flavors of blackberries, espresso, cola, tea, and bitter chocolate, but made more interesting by fresh acidity not often seen in today's better Merlots. This cool-climate wine also has sturdy tannins that suggest mid-term aging.",88
,Murphy-Goode 2000 Reserve Fume Sauvignon Blanc (Alexander Valley),"A great and versatile food wine. Its polished flavors of lime, fig and apricot are drizzled with Oriental spices and smoky oak. One of California's  most consistent wines, and rich enough to stand in for Chardonnay.",88
Roger Voss,Kynsi 1999 Paragon Vineyard Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),"Delicate and complex, a cool climate wine with a mixture of ripe cherry flavors and leaner ones of tobacco, tomato skin, and cranberry. Bone dry with excellent acidity, this somewhat tart wine is well made, and may be an ager.",88
Joe Czerwinski,Cantina Terlano 2002 Terlano Classico White (Alto Adige),"A blend of grapes, so maybe it is not surprising that the aromas and flavors are a blend: melons, pears and limes, all presented with great freshness and verve alongside a rich texture. Editors' Choice.",88
Michael Schachner,Casa Julia 2001 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),"Right off the bat this wine is pure and smooth. The nose is pretty, with cranberry and cassis. Next up is a palate of pure red fruit and only a light shading of oak. The finish draws applause for its clarity and buttery nuances. It's what a good Chilean Cabernet should be; it's ripe and easy to drink, yet fairly solid and impressive. Best Buy.",88
Michael Schachner,Valdivieso 2001 Reserve Chardonnay (Central Valley),"With full oak and pineapple aromas along with a big mouthful of spicy apple and pear fruit, this is no weakling. On the contrary, it's full and meaty, with a lot of texture and extract. The feel is healthy even if the acidity is on the low side. A very good wine to drink now; it probably won't age that well.",88
,Bridlewood 2000 Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),"A lovely wine, made even more attractive by the value price. It has flavors and lemons and limes and a ripe, sweet edge of honey, although it's technically dry. The acidity is clean and refreshing.",87
Michael Schachner,San Pedro 2002 Castillo de Molina Reserva Chardonnay (Lontué Valley),"Strongly oaked, but fresh, young and healthy in the nose. The smell of coconut and lemon curd is friendly and soft, while the palate is loaded with more lemon, coconut, pear and nutmeg. The texture is rich, and, for now, the acidity is bright. A solid Chardonnay for current drinking.",87
Michael Schachner,Undurraga 2001 Reserva Merlot (Maipo Valley),"Smooth smelling, with pure and fresh berry and plum aromas. Very young and a bit tangy on the palate, with cherry and berry flavors and an oaky, soft finish that goes sweet then sour, and lasts for a long time. In terms of structure, it's balanced, mildly tannic, yet meant for drinking now.",87
Roger Voss,Conti Formentini 2001 Rylint White (Collio),"This is the first vintage of this blend of Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio and Sauvignon Blanc, named after the 16th-century abbess Rylint Formentini. Peppery in character, with rich, complex fruit, it has citric flavors, along with a sense of structure and acidity.",87
,Cline 2007 Ancient Vines Zinfandel (California),"Rich in spicy, briary berry-cherry and chocolate fruit, with ultra-smooth tannins, and just enough acidity to cut through barbecue sauce. It's a bit sweet and Porty on its own.",85
Michael Schachner,Cono Sur 2008 Visión Pinot Noir (Colchagua Valley),"Fresh aromas of red cherry and light berry fruit precede a palate that runs a little racy, with borderline tart plum and pie cherry flavors. A solid mouthfeel and mild, chalky tannins give it presence, and for sure it's a clean, sturdy wine. But that's really as far as it goes.",85
Michael Schachner,Aresti 2008 Estate Selection Sauvignon Blanc (Curicó Valley),"On the plump but balanced side, with a perfumed nose that's almost sweet for SB. In the mouth, it's fairly lively and lifted, with nectarine and melon flavors that morph into pink grapefruit on the finish. Decent quality; will get the job done.",85
,Astoria 2008 Extra Dry  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene),"The wine starts off slowly due to a note of almond nut or cardboard that masks the natural fruit. Once it gets started, however, this luminous sparkling Prosecco offers cheerful notes of stone fruit and pear.",85
,Cantine Maschio NV Brut Prosecco (Italy),"Tonic and lean with a nearly transparent color and lively perlage, this non-DOC Prosecco offers candy-like aromas of butterscotch and lemon soda. There's an interesting touch of crushed white peppercorn in there as well and this well-priced wine would make a perfect match to appetizers and finger foods.",85
,Val d'Oca 2008 Millesimato Extra Dry  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene),"This Extra Dry (slightly sweet) vintage Prosecco delivers a lean, slightly watery style and piquant bubbles that recall lemon soda. The wine is firm and steely in the mouth with tonic bubbling and layers of fresh fruit on the close.",85
Michael Schachner,Viña Bisquertt 2007 Casa la Joya Reserve Syrah (Colchagua Valley),"Formerly doing business as “Shiraz,” this Syrah from Bisquertt offers a huge purple tint, roasted aromas of blackberry and campfire, and a ripe, grapey palate that brims with simple, racy black cherry, pepper and other driving flavors.

Michael Schachner,Lapostolle 2007 Casa Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley),"Aromas of baked apple, nut oil and toast are mildly appealing, while the round, dry palate is home to flavors of melon and bitter pith.

Jim Gordon,Prospect 772 2014 Stepping Stones Grenache Blanc (Santa Barbara County),"Smoky aromas and a bold apricot flavor give this dry and seemingly light-bodied wine a distinct personality.

Anna Lee C. Iijima,Wölffer 2013 Caya Cabernet Franc (Long Island),"Voluptuous blackberry and plum flavors are edged by hints of bitter coffee and spice in this richly bodied wine.

,Rusack 2011 Solomon Hills Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"With a wine this finely constructed, the question is always ageability. There's no question about the immediate deliciousness.

,Bell 2009 Clone 6 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon was grown in the well-known Beckstoffer Georges III Vineyard. It's at a funny stage of development, with primary cherry and blackberry fruit starting to fade, while sage, dill, green olive and dried fruit notes are emerging.

Roger Voss,Winzer Krems 2011 Kellermeister Privat Goldberg Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal),"This is a soft, creamed-apple style of wine, with a great shaft of acidity cutting through the crisp fruit. Kiwi and gooseberry fruits are lifted on the bright, lively finish.",87
Paul Gregutt,Zerba Cellars 2008 Sangiovese (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Tart and lively, this medium-bodied Sangiovese was co-fermented with small amounts of Syrah and Viognier. The Viognier contributes scents of citrus and stone fruit, which add some welcome complexity.",87
Paul Gregutt,Insania 2009 Red (Red Mountain),"Produced by Three Rivers for celebrity winemaker Geoff Tate, the Insania is actually rather tame. Pretty fruit flavors of berry, cherry and plum introduce the wine gracefully, then run into some stiff, drying, chalky tannins.",87

Michael Schachner,Aleo 2009 Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León),"Full and smoky, with bacon, blackberry and tire rubber on the nose. This is a bit grating in feel due to full tannins and acids, with wild berry flavors, bitter oak, black plum and darkness. Lengthy on the finish.",87
,Altùris 2011 White (Venezia Giulia),"A blend of 70% Pinot Grigio and 30% Ribolla Gialla, this bright white opens with floral notes of jasmine and honeysuckle, white pepper and stone fruit. The Ribolla Gialla element adds structure and notes of caramel and pineapple.",87
Paul Gregutt,Camaraderie 2009 Clifton Vineyard Syrah (Wahluke Slope),"Medium bodied, this sharply defined wine brings in plenty of notes of herb, root and earth around its light berry fruit. It captures the defining flavors of Wahluke Slope Syrah in a somewhat muted style, reflecting the abbreviated growing season.",87
Paul Gregutt,Camaraderie 2009 Tempranillo (Yakima Valley),"This is a mix of fruit from both warm and cool vineyards, crafting a clean, fresh, lightly herbal wine with a pleasing dusty character. Hints of cocoa and toast annotate the tart berry fruit, with a thread of smoke and chalk running through the tannins.",87
Virginie Boone,Beringer 2014 Quantum Red (Napa Valley),"This would be a straightforward Bordeaux red blend if not for the 5% Petite Sirah within. Together, it's 74% Cabernet Sauvignon, 12% Merlot, 7% Cabernet Franc and 2% Malbec as well, sourced from Howell Mountain and valley floor sites. Dusty and herbal, the wine is thick and sizably tannic, with dense black fruit, leather and coffee.",91
Matt Kettmann,Big Basin 2014 Coastview Vineyard Chardonnay (Monterey County),"Flint and smoke aromas show strongly on this bottling, alongside hints of lemon balm and a rustic apple cider vinegar savory kick. Tangy smoked tangerine flavors show on the energized sip, where a unique sandalwood smoky quality plays with more cider-like tang.",91
Roger Voss,Boude Baudin 2010 Cuvée St Clément  (Champagne),"This potentially rich Champagne is still young. The Chardonnay and Pinot Noir that dominate the blend show tight acidity, minerality and a tangy, orange-like edge. Give it time to mature, and it will be splendid.",91
Roger Voss,Boude Baudin NV B. Zéro Brut Dosage  (Champagne),"Aged for an extra two years to soften its tense acidity, this Champagne is defiantly bone-dry yet not searing. Its ripe and rich fruitiness cushions the crisp acidity and taut, nervy citrus character. Drink now.",91
Virginie Boone,Conn Creek 2013 El Adobo Ranch Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Chiles Valley),"Big tannins support the layers of extracted, concentrated fruit that leans red into cherry, cassis and currant. Char and vanilla speak for the oak.",91
Michael Schachner,Cono Sur 2012 20 Barrels Limited Edition Peralillo Estate Merlot (Colchagua Valley),"Baked blueberry and boysenberry aromas are more ripe than delicate. This Merlot is saturated and deeply tannic. Flavors of coffee, chocolate and lemon peel precede a toasty finish that overflows with chocolaty oak and lingering tannins. Drink through 2023.",91
Virginie Boone,D.R. Stephens 2014 Silver Eagle Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Delicate in cranberry and strawberry, this wine is highlighted in uplifted acidity and plenty of length and breadth within its medium-bodied structure. A pleasing streak of cardamom is consistent throughout, as accents of forest floor and cola figure in.",91
Virginie Boone,Davis Family 2014 Soul Patch Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is a relatively thick and dense wine, grippy in tannin and oak at first, youthful and desiring of time and air. Beyond its strength, its shows the beginnings of delicacy and grace, commingling raspberry with clove and tea.",91
Virginie Boone,Davis Family 2014 Starr Ridge Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is a soft, smooth and earthy wine, still unraveling from its youth, that's crisp and fresh in acidity. Chewy still in texture, it offers a glorious celebration of red cherry, rhubarb, tea and clove.",91
Roger Voss,Domaine Jeannin-Naltet 2014 Le Clos l'Evêque Premier Cru  (Mercurey),"From a walled vineyard once owned by the local bishop, this wine is structured and firm while also having great red cherry and berry fruit. It's one of a number of Premier Crus from this producer—and certainly the most expressive with its generous fruit and balanced tannins. Drink from 2018.",91
Jim Gordon,Prospect 772 2014 The Brat Grenache (Calaveras County),"Deliciously fruity but also well-structured, this full-bodied wine has excellent concentration and good balance. Effusive aromas of blueberry and black cherry lead to opulent but not overripe berry flavors that are lightly accented by clove and cinnamon nuances.",91
Matt Kettmann,Qupé 2013 Doux Sawyer Lindquist Vineyard Marsanne (Edna Valley),"Bob Lindquist is almost certainly the only vintner in America that is drying Marsanne on straw mats to make a dessert wine. The result is aromas of Asian pear, white peach, baked apple and baking spice, more fresh rather than sweet. It is viscous on the sip, and the sweetness steadily grows on the palate, offering cotton candy flavors. Fascinating stuff.",91
Matt Kettmann,Qupé 2013 Sawyer Lindquist Vineyard Grenache (Edna Valley),"This is a delicate yet flavorful take on this grape, from a biodynamic, cool-climate vineyard. Light red plum and hibiscus aromas meet with sweet herbs and cinnamon spice on the nose. The lithe palate offers candied strawberry with thyme, anise and touches of garden herbs, with that red fruit flavor carrying deep into the finish. Would pair great with spicy food.",91
Paul Gregutt,Rex Hill 2014 Sims Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"The Sims is amped up in 2014, dark and thick and showing a roasted character. Mocha, black tea and Kahlua flavors push the palate into a gritty charred mode. It's delicious, liquorous, and suitable for smoky ribs or a juicy burger. Drink now through 2020.",91
Paul Gregutt,Ruby 2015 Steve's Reserve Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"There's a whiff of volatility upon opening, then a rush of bright, tangy orange and cherry fruit. The 20% new oak aging does not really come through in scent or flavor. Though not in any way effervescent, this young release carries an impression of carbonation in the finish. Give it another year or two of bottle age and drink after 2019.",91
Sean P. Sullivan,Structure 2014 Wallula Syrah (Horse Heaven Hills),"Wood spice, cherry and herb aromas are followed by luscious cherry flavors. It keeps you coming back for more with a high yum factor.",91
Matt Kettmann,Testarossa 2015 Rincon Vineyard Chardonnay (Arroyo Grande Valley),"There's an expert balance between lightly melted butter, pithy Meyer lemon and toasted marcona almond on the nose of this bottling from the region's iconic vineyard. The palate is wound up tightly, offering good grip and lots of textural length while showing flavors of chamomile, saffron, sea salt and more Meyer lemon rinds.",91
Paul Gregutt,Tumwater 2014 Prince Hill Vineyard Reserve Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Just 8% of this reserve spent time in new oak, putting the emphasis on juicy jammy flavors of cranberry fruit. It rolls into sour cherry, some citrus and a most refreshing, clean and vivid mouthfeel. Drink now and into the mid-2020s.",91
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Wittmann 2015 Trocken Scheurebe (Rheinhessen),"A surprising whiff of black currant on the nose of this elegant white points to Scheurebe—one of Germany's lesser-known grapes. Wittmann's version is particularly poised, offering loads of peach and grapefruit flavors, sharply contrasted by zesty lime and mineral tones. The finish is long and sleek, touched by a hint of bee pollen.",91
Roger Voss,Jeaunaux-Robin NV Brut Zéro Sélection  (Champagne),"This producer shows its preference for dry Champagnes with this bone-dry, oak-fermented bottling. With its bottle age and the softening effect of wood, it's generous and gently textured, leaving plenty of room for its bright fruit and balanced acidity to show. Drink from 2018.",91
Virginie Boone,Joseph Jewell 2014 Bucher Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"From the sought-after site on Westside Road, this wine delivers a nuanced, elegant expression of juicy red cherry, plum, pomegranate and light, compelling spice. With a depth of body and soft, integrated tannin, it's complex without being overpowering, finishing in a mix of sautéed mushroom and forest floor.",91
Michael Schachner,Lapostolle 2013 Cuvée Alexandre Apalta Vineyard Made With Organic Grapes Syrah (Colchagua Valley),"Jammy berry aromas seem reduced at first, with notes of iodine and rubber. But with airing this packed Syrah comes around. A flush saturated tannic palate is home to toasty blackened berry, coffee and spice flavors. On the finish, burnt toast and espresso flavors don't slip. Drink through 2022.",91
Paul Gregutt,Le Cadeau 2011 Blanc de Noir Sparkling (Oregon),"One of a crop of new Oregon sparklers, this was barrel fermented with native yeast and aged for 56 months prior to disgorging. Fine tiny bubbles and a fresh, yeasty aroma introduce the wine, which has excellent concentration. Green apple and green banana, a touch of cucumber and a nice toasty frame all combine gracefully. The odds are that this will continue to improve in bottle for another five years at least.",91
Paul Gregutt,Le Cadeau 2015 Diversité Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Scott Shull (Raptor Ridge) consults here. This brings a blend of clones from the estate vineyard, with ample new wood still showing through. Black fruits and a vein of coffee are also in the mix, with a balanced, somewhat muscular mouthfeel. This has the strength to stand up to a lightly blackened grilled seafood filet.",91
Paul Gregutt,Le Cadeau 2015 Équinoxe Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Slightly liquorous when first opened, this pushes the alcohol up towards a place where some of the nuances are lost. But it has plenty of flavor, power and punch. Black coffee, black cherry, black olive and black licorice are entwined here, with some heat in the follow-through. Give it a good decanting and it will start to smooth out.",91
Matt Kettmann,Le Vigne 2014 Di Domenico Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"Black plum, charred wood, coffee syrup and cracked black pepper show on the excellently bright nose of this bottling. The flavors are equally intriguing, with umami touches of charred beef along with rosemary, bay leaf, olie and more black pepper.",91
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Maximin Grünhäuser 2015 Trocken Riesling (Mosel),"Fresh green apple and grapefruit aromas are bolstered on the palate of this dry, elegantly balanced Riesling. It's light bodied yet delightfully creamy. A kiss of tangerine zest marks its moderately long finish.",91
Sean P. Sullivan,Northstar 2013 Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Merlot (63%) takes the lead on this blend followed by Cabernet Sauvignon (23%) and Cabernet Franc. The aromas seem somewhat wound up at present, with notes of wood spice, vanilla and fresh herb. The palate is über-smooth, showing a fine sense of balance and polish.",91
Virginie Boone,Padis 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A 100% varietal wine, this offers upfront structure and gravelly texture, its tannins robust. The medium-bodied ripeness allows plenty of room for dried herb and cedar, accents to the bolder notions of black raspberry jam and coffee.",91
Paul Gregutt,Paul O'Brien 2014 Bradley Vineyard Pinot Noir (Umpqua Valley),"This is sourced from 30-year-old Wädenswil vines from a vineyard in the Elkton AVA. It's complex and compelling, showing layers of stone, strawberry, citrus, chocolate and sassafras. It's an elegant wine, well proportioned and modest in scope, but delicious.",91
Matt Kettmann,Claiborne & Churchill 2014 Twin Creeks Estate Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),"Bright pomegranate and dried strawberry notes start the aromas on this bottling and then descend into more brooding cola, smoked herbs, cinnamon and spicy hibiscus. There is herbal and mineral depth to the palate, with raspberry, cranberry and pencil lead flavors that evolve toward fruit punch, thyme and earth. It's light in body but full of grippy texture.",93
Matt Kettmann,Flying Goat Cellars 2012 Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"A touch of earthy funk shows at first on the nose of this bottling, laced throughout the dark cranberry, pomegranate, crushed grapeseeds and a lavish layer of violets. The palate is heavily spiced with clove, gingerbread, a touch of juniper, lots of earthy sagebrush and a strong cranberry fruit, all seasoned by an iron-powered minerality.",93
Matt Kettmann,Flying Goat Cellars 2012 Solomon Hills Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"From one of the more exciting and westernmost vineyards in the region, this bottling shows earthy, gamey aromas alongside ripe red and purple fruits, pairing plum and black cherry with minty, musky herbs. The palate shows dried olive, tart orange peels, red plums, baked figs and pine needles, proving deliciously savory and intense.",93
Kerin O’Keefe,Abbazia di Novacella 2012 Praepositus Passito Kerner (Alto Adige Valle Isarco),"Heady scents of pressed jasmine, honey and candied orange waft out of the glass. The concentrated but elegant palate provides layers of mature apricot, lemon drop and ginger brightened by fresh acidity. It's vibrant and well balanced, with a persistent finish.",93
Virginie Boone,Midsummer Cellars 2013 Cañon Creek Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Strong elements of black pepper and smoky oak beg for steak to be paired with this 100% varietal wine. It showcases sizable weight and a solid tannic structure, with supple expressions of black cherry and chocolate that linger long on the rich finish. This bold beauty should hold well through 2023.",93
Matt Kettmann,ONX 2013 Reckoning Red (Templeton Gap District),"From Paso's blending vanguards, this mix of 62% Syrah, 19% Petite Sirah, 13% Cabernet Sauvignon and 6% Malbec offers an intriguing nose of sesame, soy, cracked pepper, fresh blackberry and raw beef. There is cedar and toasted pine on the palate as well as smoked meats, black pepper, teriyaki and an elderberry-blackberry base.",93
Virginie Boone,Les Belles Collines 2012 Les Sommets Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is a gorgeous wine, blended with 8% Merlot, 1% Petit Verdot and 1% Malbec, and aged entirely in new French oak. Juicy waves of cassis and red currant are accented by dark chocolate, ultimately showcasing a lush, plush yet structured palate. It's decadent now, but should age well through 2022.",93
Virginie Boone,Lutum 2014 Gap's Crown Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"Crisp green apple is the star in this well-made, balanced and elegant wine, that's tangy yet smooth, with a voluptuous tease of anise. Approachably structured, the complexity of the texture and lurking layers of further flavor suggest letting this wine open slowly to unveil its true self, and allowing it to linger on the palate.",93
Matt Kettmann,Turiya 2011 Stolpman Vineyard Sangiovese (Ballard Canyon),"Deep aromas of dried strawberries and blueberries meet with hot bricks, dried meats, purple flowers, a touch of smoke and secondary notes of truffle on the nose of this delicious smelling and tasting wine. The layers of flavor on the palate range from black cherry to milk chocolate, framed by chalky tannins.",93
Virginie Boone,Iron Horse 2013 Thomas Road Pinot Noir (Green Valley),"This is the producer's highest and most westerly vineyard site. It holds back from the start, still tightly wound and somewhat reduced on the nose. As it opens, ethereal layers of wild strawberry, green tea and lacings of herb and white pepper unveil to tremendous effect.",93
Kerin O’Keefe,Brandini 2011 Resa 56  (Barolo),"Scents of perfumed dark berry, rose, cake spice and aromatic herb unfold on this structured red. On the full-bodied palate, notes of chopped mint, mocha and white pepper accent a core of mature black cherry. It's young and assertive but well balanced, with firm tannins and bright acidity. Drink 2018–2026.",93
Virginie Boone,Artesa 2014 Estate Reserve Chardonnay (Carneros),"The estate-grown grapes for this wine come from some of the appellation's highest-elevation sites, at the base of Mount Veeder. Natural acidity is the star of the show, a nice surprise after a decadent honeyed color and bouquet. Serious texture and complexity give way to a touch of salted caramel and peach.",93
Virginie Boone,Carlisle 2013 Pagani Ranch Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"From the gorgeous, mighty Pagani, planted in 1895, comes this powerfully rich and refined wine, a study in woodsy rusticity and layers of fig, blackberry and a stick of cinnamon. Full bodied and luxurious on the palate, a lithe jolt of acidity rears its head just before the finish, trying to compete with the licorice and leather. Drink now through 2020.",93
Roger Voss,Château Vignelaure 2015 Rosé (Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence),"Coming from a remote estate on the edge of the Lubéron mountains in the north of Provence, this wine is impressively rich. It gains great concentration and structure from the Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah in the blend. Full of ripe red fruits, it is dense at the end.",93
Michael Schachner,Clos d'Argentine 2013 Winemaker's Selection Reserva Malbec (Mendoza),"Smoky, charred aromas of blackberry and blackened spices set up a bold palate with energy to spare. Blackberry and cassis flavors are rich, toasty and chocolaty, while the finish on this full-bodied, ripe Malbec is lengthy and moderately complex. Drink through 2021.",93
Roger Voss,Mas de Cadenet 2015 Mas Negrel Cadenet Rosé (Côtes de Provence Sainte-Victoire),"Named after the Negrel family, owners of the estate, this is the top cuvée in their range. Aging in wood gives it a surprising series of flavors ranging from caramel to spice to buttery toast. While some of the fruit is lost along the way, the wine has a rounded, very complete character that is rich and made for food.",93
Sean P. Sullivan,Passing Time 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills),"Discovery Vineyard Cab makes up most of this wine, with just a splash of Champoux vineyard Franc to fill it out. Very pretty, very focused aromas of spice box, red and black fruit and herb are followed by a fruit-forward, shamelessly appealing yet still elegant, balanced palate that puts a premium on purity, with a well integrated structure surrounding it all.",93
Michael Schachner,Resalte 2010 Gran Resalte  (Ribera del Duero),"Welcoming aromas of wood spice, plum and blackberry become more smoky with airing.

Drink from 2017 through 2030.",93
Matt Kettmann,Sanctuary 2013 Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Winemaker Dennis Martin puts grape grower Stephen Miller's signature on this wine, a nod to the importance of this historic vineyard. The wine shows bright strawberry and raspberry with touch of savory wood smoke as well as hibiscus-laced pastry and a pinch of thyme. Earthy sagebrush and wild herb flavors frame the palate, where cooked cherries and cranberries are spiced by cardamom and dried ginger spice.",93
Jim Gordon,Terre Rouge 2014 Enigma White (Sierra Foothills),"It's fun to rattle off a few of the numerous aromas and flavors in this exotic but subtle wine: tangerine, pastry cream, blanched almonds and a touch of honey. The wine is refreshing, dry and nicely braced with acidity, but at the same time rather broad and soothing in texture. In other words, beautifully balanced and wonderfully complex.",93
Virginie Boone,Limerick Lane 2013 Hail Mary Syrah-Grenache (Russian River Valley),"This mostly Syrah blends in 6% Grenache, combining the two grapes from the property's estate into an opaque, juicy expression of black licorice, tar, cigar, grilled mushrooms atop a meaty steak and plenty of black pepper. Big and bold in every sense of the word, it retains just enough acidity to maintain an inviting nature and beguiling floral backbone.",93
Virginie Boone,Limerick Lane 2013 Headpruned Block Syrah (Russian River Valley),"As the name makes clear, this wine is made from a head-pruned, older block of very unlikely Syrah at the estate property, as seductive as rare. Plum, black cherry, leather and black pepper jump from the glass, slowly and with purpose, around a core of burly tannin and intensely floral aromatics. This is a great wine.",93
Jim Gordon,Loring Wine Company 2014 Durell Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"In the big, ripe and saturated school of winemaking, this wine has a deep color, oodles of black cherry and blackberry flavors and full body. It also has enough firm tannin and acidity to keep the structure lively and the finish fresh, so it's a lot of fun to drink and can take on all kinds of rich proteins at dinner.",93
Virginie Boone,Eighty Four 2010 Petite Sirah (Napa Valley),"This is big boisterous wine from Elias Fernandez and Doug Shafer that has been given some nice time in bottle after four years in new French oak. It's a viscous, black-as-night kind of experience. Coconut macaroon and juicy blackberry and blueberry substantiate structured, integrated tannin, finishing with an unexpected elegance.",93
Matt Kettmann,Flying Goat Cellars 2012 Rancho Santa Rosa Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Plump black plums and concentrated hibiscus fruit meet with cola, sarsaparilla and tart dried orange rind on the nose of this bottling. The palate is more earth-driven, with crushed rocks, pine needle and mint flavors spicing up the tart plum skins and berries. The texture is excitingly grippy.",93
Matt Kettmann,Four Lanterns 2013 Fire Light Syrah (Paso Robles),"Spicy cracked peppercorns, light tar, fresh picked lavender and light purple fruits show on the savory nose of this bottling. More strong pepper notes show on the palate, as do tart elderberries, sesame, soy and hoisin elements, with a nice smoked meat character adding to the delicious complexity.",93
Matt Kettmann,Turiya 2011 Shapeshifter Red (Central Coast),"There's magic in this 65% Petit Verdot and 35% Sangiovese combination. This shows concentrated cherry and kirsch aromas, touches of shiitake and porcini mushrooms and plenty of turned, wet earth aromas. The palate, framed by chalky tannins, offers more mushrooms and truffles in a black cherry-chocolate gravy, proving quite luxurious and interesting at once.",93
Virginie Boone,World's End 2013 If Six Was Nine Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Softened by 6% Merlot, this lovely concoction opens with a waft of smoky cigar box, becoming a bold, loud expression of the variety dotted in classic notes of cassis and cedar. A luxuriously velvety texture is the standout, though, supported by great structure and length.",93
Michael Schachner,Benegas 2011 Benegas Lynch La Encerrada Estate Vineyard Malbec (Mendoza),"Smoky and intense from the get-go, this saturated, black-as-night Malbec is full of blackberry, cassis and gamy aromas.

Drink through 2023.",93
Virginie Boone,W.H. Smith 2012 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),"This is a lovely wine, classically rendered in cedar, herb and red cherry. The dried herb and forest floor elements persist on the palate, with bursts of acidity giving it life and lingering persistence, the tannins well-integrated.",93
Sean P. Sullivan,Alleromb 2014 La Reyna Blanca Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The aromas are bright, with notes of barrel spice, vanilla, pineapple and lees. The palate is full bodied, with textured and richly flavored tropical fruit notes that lead to a warm vanilla-filled finish. The oak seems a bit heavy handed.",89
Sean P. Sullivan,Ardor 2015 Art Den Hoed Vineyard Syrah (Yakima Valley),"Aromas of sea salt, olive brine, smoked meat, herb and earth lead to medium-bodied fruit flavors that run warm on the finish. There are plenty of good things going on but they don't seem to entirely come together.",89
Jim Gordon,Berryessa Gap 2015 Albariño (Yolo County),"This wine tastes fresh and brisk, like apricots and lemons, yet a silky-smooth texture adds depth and interest to make it more than just a one-note, fruity style of wine. It comes from an over-achieving winery located one county inland from Napa.",89
Kerin O’Keefe,Brezza 2015  Dolcetto d'Alba,"Here's a mouthwatering, succulent red that arrives with aromas and flavors of juicy black cherry, licorice, white pepper and graphite. It's light bodied, fresh and savory, with solid but polished tannins. An almond note gives it a pleasantly bitter finish. It's made to be drunk young so enjoy soon.",89
Roger Voss,Château Bois Chantant 2015  Bordeaux Supérieur,"Fruity and ripe, the wine also has some solid structure to give it a core of dark tannins. The black-currant fruits are developing well, bringing their crispness to the party. Drink this wine from 2018.",89
Joe Czerwinski,Château de Campuget 2016 Tradition Rosé (Costières de Nîmes),"This bend of 70% Syrah and 30% Grenache is nevertheless very pale in hue. the nose hints at wet stone, thyme and bay leaf, while the medium-bodied palate delivers a harmonious blend of red berries and citrus. Long on the finish, with mouthwatering persistence.",89
Roger Voss,Château de l'Aubrade 2015  Bordeaux Supérieur,"This is a juicy wine with its red fruits and attractive acidity. The wood aging still shows, perhaps too strongly, but that fruit is already a major factor in the success of the wine. Drink from 2019.",89
Roger Voss,Château de Pressac 2014 Les Terrasses de Pressac  (Saint-Émilion),"From a Grand Cru estate, this second wine shows the same rich fruit and generous structure as the winery's first wine. It's just softer with an approachable character and generous black fruits that will enable it to mature relatively quickly. Drink from 2020.",89
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Chateau Lafayette Reneau 2016 Pinot Noir Rosé (Finger Lakes),"Ripe luscious black-cherry and berry notes lend heft to this bold concentrated rosé. It's just a shade off dry, but balances neatly, juxtaposing crisp acidity against lavish texture and a pleasantly clingy finish.",89
Roger Voss,Château Maison Noble Saint Martin 2015 Château Jean de Bel Air  (Bordeaux),"A ripe perfumed wine with fine tannins as well as dense fruit. Blackberry flavors are up there along with the acidity and crisp aftertaste. It's a wine with a good future, ready to drink from 2018.",89

Sean P. Sullivan,Savage Grace 2016 Orange Oak Ridge Vineyard Gewürztraminer (Columbia Gorge (WA)),"This one-of-a-kind in the state wine was fermented on skins for 12 days, giving it a light-orange color.

Put it on the dinner table to see it shine.",89
Sean P. Sullivan,Seven Falls 2013 Merlot (Wahluke Slope),"The aromas are so light you need to strain to get at them, with notes of vanilla, coffee and cherry. The palate brings plentiful coffee and cherry flavors that show a pleasing sense of texture. One wants more aromatically, but the palate delivers.",89
Matt Kettmann,Silvertip 2014 Unfiltered Estate Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"This incredibly zesty and fruity bottling shows raspberry, lavender and white pepper on the nose. It's fun to sip, with snappy red fruits and hibiscus most prominent. Complexity comes from touches of rooibos tea and potpourri. It's still extremely youthful.",89
Anne Krebiehl MW,Steininger 2016 Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),"That herbal, yeasty tang of Grüner is on display on the nose. The dry palate further brings out the earthy aspect with miso, stone, yeast and lemon. The body is light and balanced with a savory but diffuse finish.",89
Sean P. Sullivan,Stevens 2016 StevensSteel Chardonnay (Yakima Valley),"This is an expressive example of this variety, especially considering the stainless steel aging.

Jim Gordon,Trinity River 2015 Chardonnay,"It's always a treat to discover a good, well-made but not overpowering wine. This one has nothing in excess, just moderate and crisp fruit flavors with light spicy accents. An appetizing texture backed by good acidity leads to a clean, dry finish. This unoaked wine from northern California should be a crowd pleaser.",89
Anne Krebiehl MW,Umathum 2015 Zweigelt (Burgenland),"A dark, smoky smudge seems to cover the red-cherry notes on the nose. The palate is juicy and light, with this red-cherry nature at its core. Easy and light, it's a perfect fruit-driven summer red.",89
Matt Kettmann,Vintage Cowboy 2016 Chardonnay (Paso Robles),"Sweet honeysuckle, lime blossoms and honeydew show on the very flowery nose of this bottling from a newer property near the old mining town of Pozo. The sip tightens up smartly with Anjou pear and honeysuckle flavors, but it's the powerful acidity that makes for a compelling palate.",89
Anne Krebiehl MW,Winzer Krems 2016 GV Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),"Almost luscious pear aromas and notes of peardrop make for a very fruity nose.

Sullivan,Kontos 2014 Summit View Vineyard Malbec (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Purple fruit and wood spice intermingle on the aromas, along with clove, herb and baking spice, showing a touch of volatility. The fruit flavors are big and bold, bringing a sense of structure and liveliness. It's an intriguing example of the variety from an up-and-coming vineyard.",89
Anne Krebiehl MW,Landhaus Mayer 2016 Riesling (Niederösterreich),"A hint of tropicality hovers above the nose, recalling passion fruit. The palate restricts itself to fresh lemon and green apple. This is light, dry, juicy and refreshing—ideal for a sunny day as a light apéritif.",89
Joe Czerwinski,Lavau 2015 La Decelle Red,"This medium-bodied blend of 50% Grenache and 50% Syrah is simple but satisfying. Ripe cherries and raspberries carry the load, dressed up by hints of vanilla and cinnamon. A soft dustiness marks the texture, turning silky on the finish. Drink now–2020.",89
Sean P. Sullivan,L'Ecole No. 41 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is a true pan-Washington Cabernet, with fruit coming from 12 different vineyards scattered across the Columbia Valley. It's 100% varietal as aromas of char, toast, black cherry meats, herb, cranberry and spice are followed by elegantly styled dark-fruit flavors. The tannins bring a bit of heft and grip.",89
Susan Kostrzewa,Lyrarakis 2015 Vilana (Crete),"This indigenous Cretan variety shows its character in the deft hands of Lyrarakis, grown at high altitude. Aromas of fresh pineapple, citrus and flowers lead into pear, green apple and saline notes. Balanced and bright.",89
Anne Krebiehl MW,Malat 2016 Furth-Palt Riesling (Kremstal),"A touch of funky yeastiness plays on the nose before the lemon zestiness shines through. The palate is slender and light, focusing on that bright, fresh lemon note. This is easy, juicy and very refreshing.",89
Matt Kettmann,Midnight 2013 Starlight Sangiovese (Paso Robles),"Light and lively aromas of dried red berries, concentrated roses, cola and black plums show on the nose of this very accessible and pleasurable Sangiovese. The cohesive palate integrates cherry, cola and milk-chocolate flavors into an easy-drinking frame, perfect for barbecues or family-style Italian meals.",89
,Michael Pozzan 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"An easy Cabernet, soft and fruity, great for drinking now, at a pretty good price. It's dry and gentle in the mouth, with some real complexity, combining ripe cherries and blackberries with suggestions of dried herbs, cocoa and tobacco.",87
,Michele Chiarlo 2011 Le Marne  (Gavi),"Crisp and light with pretty mineral dustings behind the ripe peach and melon aromas, this Gavi shows a full and generous style. Its nicest quality is that it offers both softness in the mouth and elegance on the bouquet.",87
Michael Schachner,Monte Xanic 2012 Viña Kristel Sauvignon Blanc (Valle de Guadalupe),"Sauvignon Blanc is, in general, one of Baja's more consistent performers. This version is light in color, with varietally familiar aromas of nettle, grapefruit and passion fruit. It's a bit weighty, with apple, grapefruit and tropical flavors. A mild bitterness can be found on the finish.",87
,Paoletti 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Oak Knoll District),"There's plenty of ripe berry-cherry fruit, fine acids and big tannins on this Cab, but it just doesn't have the stuffing for the long haul. It is, however, a satisfying Cabernet, offering lots of elegance for drinking now and over the next few years.",87
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Peconic Bay Winery 2010 Cabernet Franc (North Fork of Long Island),"Ripe and luscious, this decadent Cabernet Franc is chock full of ripe red cherry and plum fruit, accented with purple violets and fresh herb tones. It's bold in alcohol and soft in style, but delicately framed by brisk acidity and a ruffle of feathery tannins.",87
Michael Schachner,Príncipe de Viana 2008 Reserva 1423 Red (Navarra),"Bright red-fruit aromas are matched by dry spice and leathery scents. The feel on this blend of Tempranillo, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot is juicy and clampy, while flavors of red cherry, plum and currant come with a vanilla shading. This finishes crisp, with punchy acidity.",87
Michael Schachner,Proemio 2009 Gran Reserve Winemaker's Selection Red (Mendoza),"Mild berry and cherry aromas are standard and slightly oaky. The palate on this blend of Malbec, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah is choppy and tannic, while earthy flavors of cherry and plum are pushed by firm acids. This finishes tannic, with coffee and herbal flavors.",87
Sean P. Sullivan,Quady North 2011 Bomba Grenache (Rogue Valley),"It's rare to find a varietally labeled Grenache that comes in under 13% alcohol, but here you have it. Blended with 10% Syrah, it has notes of white pepper, smoked meat, savory spices and red fruit. What it lacks in terms of depth it makes up for in purity and elegance.",87
Sean P. Sullivan,Quady North 2011 Steel-Ox Viognier (Rogue Valley),"Named after the blending of Steelhead Run and Ox vineyard blocks, this appealing wine is fresh and varietal with notes of ripe peach and herbs. Aged six months in stainless steel and coming in at a low 12% alcohol, the fruit concentration is lighter in style but still offers enjoyment.",87
Roger Voss,Quinta do Portal 2012 Verdelho and Sauvignon Blanc White (Douro),"Verdelho and Sauvignon Blanc hangs together easily on this herb-dominant wine. The texture has a creamy character, showing green fruits, lively acidity and a bright orange-zest aftertaste.",87
Paul Gregutt,Raptor Ridge 2012 Estate Grüner Veltliner (Chehalem Mountains),"Grüner Veltliner, though still rare, shows good promise in Oregon. This is a big, sappy, ripe version that's borderline syrupy, with big flavors of peaches and apricots. But the supporting acids, and a lick of mineral, keep it from crashing.",87
,Rodney Strong 2012 Charlotte's Home Estate Sauvignon Blanc (Northern Sonoma),"A touch of oak adds a sweet, smoky creaminess to this wine, but it's really dominated by Sauvignon Blanc's acidity and racy spearmint and tropical fruit. The alcohol is moderate, making it easy to drink.",87
,Saintsbury 2010 Toyon Farm Pinot Noir (Carneros),"This is a good Pinot Noir that's full-bodied, dry and silky in the mouth, with crisp acidity. It shows raspberry, cola and green tea flavors. Hard to predict if it has a future, so drink now–2014.",87
,Sextant 2010 Caverio G-S-M (Paso Robles),"This is an easy, gentle wine that's a little soft, with superripe cherry, persimmon and red licorice flavors. Delicious in the California way, it's showing its best now.",87
Roger Voss,Solar de Pinheiro 2012 Paço de São Lourenço White (Vinho Verde),"With its light prickle on the tongue, this is as fresh as possible. It's clean, packed with green and citrus fruits, and boosted with some textured richness. Drink at once.",87
,Suavia 2011  Soave Classico,"The dynamic sisters that run this estate deliver a clean and territory-driven line of white wines. This easy Soave Classico opens with peach, pear, citrus and a touch of fragrant honeysuckle flower. It's pure and focused overall.",87
Michael Schachner,Tilia 2011 Malbec (Mendoza),"Four years running this wine has scored 87 and been a Best Buy. The bouquet is scratchy but nicely aromatic, including hints of spice to go with ripe berry scents. The palate is jammy and home to rooty berry, mild spice and very light oak flavors. The finish is a bit hot and fiery, which food will tame.",87
,B Cellars 2011 Dutton Ranch Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"This Chardonnay wants time to warm and breathe in the glass, so don't pour it right from the fridge. After a little while it develops considerably in generosity, offering waves of tropical fruits, peaches and pears. The oak is pretty strong, even jarring. Give it a few years in the cellars to let everything knit together.",87
,Bacio della Luna 2012 Millesimato Extra Dry  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore),This bubbly Prosecco Superiore offers vibrant tones of white flower and cut grass followed by light touches of peach and honeydew melon. The mouthfeel is creamy and soft with a subtle touch of sweetness.,87
,Barlow 2009 Unfiltered Merlot (Calistoga),"Softly delicious, this is a beautiful Merlot to drink now. It's a little hot in alcohol on the finish, but feels elegant in the mouth, offering waves of cherries, currants and mocha.",87
,Borgo Maragliano NV Brut Chardonnay (Piedmont),"Here's a Chardonnay-based sparkler from Piedmont that opens with bright tones of lemon and sweet grapefruit followed by yeasty tones of freshly baked bread. There's some bitter almond as well, which adds tartness to the finish.",87
,Bortolotti NV Dry  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore),"Extra sweetness and density give this wine a full and generous personality. Dry Proseccos usually show a little extra peach juice and nectarine, as this wine does, without being heavy or cloying.",87
,Claiborne & Churchill 2010 Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),"An easy Pinot Noir, but by no means lacking elegance. It shows the moderate body and crisp, citrusy acidity that usually marks Edna Valley Pinot Noir, with pure, direct flavors of sour-cherry candy, cola, cinnamon and toast.",87
Sean P. Sullivan,Coiled 2009 Sidewinder Red,"Mostly Syrah, with just a dash of Petite Sirah (2%) and Petit Verdot (1%), this red from Sawtooth and Skyline vineyards brings light notes of smoked meat, chocolate, and flowers. The enjoyment here is mainly focused on mouthfeel, which is voluptuous and rich, leading to an open finish.",87
Sean P. Sullivan,Coiled 2010 Black Mamba Red,"This unusual blend of 85% Syrah, 10% Petit Verdot and 5% Petite Sirah comes together nicely, with the Syrah lending notes of cranberry and smoked meat and the Petit(e)s adding some heft to the plush texture and bitterness on the finish.",87
Sean P. Sullivan,Colter's Creek 2010 Koos-Koos-Kia Colter's Creek Vineyard Red (Idaho),"Named after the Nez Perce name for the Clearwater River, this blend is mostly Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, with some Cabernet Franc and Syrah thrown in the mix. The aromas are light, with notes of berry and sweet spices. The cherry flavors are very soft, getting a bit attenuated on the back half on this otherwise pleasant red.",87
,Corte Falco 2010  Soave,Here's a pure expression of the Garganega grape that sees (in part) 8 months of oak aging for extra density and thickness. The wine shows spicy notes of cinnamon and white pepper backed by peach and candied fruit.,87
,Domenico Cavazza 2008 Memorio Creari  (Gambellara Classico),"Made with the indigenous Garganega grape (the same variety that makes Soave), this richly extracted white wine opens with an off-gold color and ripe notes of apricot and peach nectar.",87
,Cascina La Ghersa 2009 Sivoy White (Monferrato),"This pretty white wine from northern Italy opens with an ashy, mineral feel and segues to aromas of candied fruit, peach and citrus. It is nearing the end of its drinking window so don't bother putting this bottle aside.",87
Joe Czerwinski,Kangarilla Road 2012 Alluvial Fans Shiraz (McLaren Vale),"This plush, full-bodied wine is already delicious, delivering wave after wave of savory fruit flavor, something like soy-marinated, char-grilled beef. Tannins are supple enough to make this wine drinkable now, yet plentiful enough to suggest ample cellaring potential. Drink now-2030.",92
Virginie Boone,Walt 2013 Pinpoint Extreme Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Each year, this wine is intended to be an experiment. This vintage's creativity involves the addition of soil from the Santa Rita Hills to vineyards in the Russian River Valley. Yeasty on the nose, the result is rich and decadent, a wine that's juicy and velvety in black and red fruit and pillowy tannins. A warmth of spice lingers on the finish.",92
Paul Gregutt,WillaKenzie Estate 2013 Aliette Pinot Noir,"From the oldest part of the estate, this subtle wine rewards your patience and full attention. Hints of rose petals adorn the floral accents, while the midpalate emphasizes flavors of raspberries and orange peel. At first a bit shy, this opens slowly and reveals hidden complexities and enduring length. Drink now through 2025.",92
Anne Krebiehl MW,Willm 2011 Vendanges Tardives Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"Lifted notes of honey and rose petal play on the nose, the palate is altogether more lively than the nose suggests: sprightly and fresh, concentrated and caramel-tinged with lemon freshness. This strikes an appetizing, moreish palate and makes for joyful drinking.",92
Anne Krebiehl MW,Jean-Marc Bernhard 2013 Wineck-Schlossberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"Ripe fragrant, yellow mirabelle plums constitute the chief perfume of this charming wine. The palate holds even more fruity nuance but is dry, concentrated and linear, being carried forward by zesty freshness and lemony overtones. This is clean, charming, taut and dry with a bracing nature and a clean, brisk finish.",92
Joe Czerwinski,Yeringberg 2013 Viognier (Yarra Valley),"This full-bodied wine is rich without ever seeming overdone. Subtle smoke notes frame bold fruit—tangerine, pineapple and apricot—and gingery spice, while the finish is long, peppery and refreshing. Drink now–2020.",92
Virginie Boone,Armida 2013 Tina's Block Maple Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"From a two-acre block within the amazing Maple Vineyard planted in 1910, this wine also contains 10% Petite Sirah and 10% mixed blacks. Baked berry pie comes to mind first, conjuring up all things good and right in the world, topped in bourbon whipped cream and nutmeg. Good acidity buoys the proceedings. Drink now through 2021.",92
Michael Schachner,Marqués de Murrieta 2010 Capellanía Viura (Rioja),"Aromas of wood grain, vanilla, butter and fino Sherry are elegant and attractive for this style of white Rioja. On the palate, this oak-aged Viura is smooth, while creamy flavors of oak, apricot and peach excel. A smooth finish with plenty of vanilla and core acidity indicates this will age well for another 10 years.",92
Joe Czerwinski,Torbreck 2010 The Factor Shiraz (Barossa Valley),"The Torbreck wines, with the emphasis they place on ripeness, can sometimes be controversial. This one is full bodied and rich, with dense plum and chocolate notes that verge on being fudge-like. But those elements are lifted slightly by hints of mint and bacon. Mocha joins the party on the long finish. Drink now–2025.",92
Anne Krebiehl MW,Biecher & Schaal 2014 Altenberg de Bergheim Grand Cru White (Alsace),"A rather perfumed nose hints at the Gewurztraminer that colors this Riesling with rose petal and honeysuckle notes. The co-planted varieties in this vineyard make a smashing duo since they are almost polar opposites: structured, straight-laced Riesling with its fine spine of acidity benefits from the playfulness and charm of aromatic, fleshy Gewurztraminer which in turn is lit up by Riesling's freshness. Really, this is a case where you can have the best of both worlds.",92
Anne Krebiehl MW,Domaines Schlumberger 2010 Kitterlé Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"A very subdued nose suggests some dried orange peel but the palate is full of life: there is bracing, bright and lemon-scented acidity on the dry palate and drenched stone. There is concentration and a texture of the finest, purest citrus oil. This is wonderfully mature and ready now but has the stuffing to last. Drink 2016–2020.",92
Anne Krebiehl MW,Domaines Schlumberger 2012 Kessler Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace),"There are mere hints of beeswax and marzipan on the nose. The palate opens into a structured, bright and well-lit space of pear peel, pear juice and a wonderfully bitter edge. This is off-dry and concentrated, definite but with a light touch. There is an intriguing hint of bitter orange peel that draws you in and pull this onto a higher plane.",92
Matt Kettmann,Foxen 2014 Tinaquaic Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),"Yields tend to be low in this dry-farmed vineyard, which especially struggles during a drought, but the quality is fantastic. Aromas of browned toast, popcorn, Meyer-lemon pith, honey pollen and a mineral herbal chamomile character show on the nose. A vibrant chalkiness reveals itself on the sip, with lemon blossom and grapefruit pith keeping the palate tight, grippy and texturally zippy.",92
Virginie Boone,Les Belles Collines 2014 Pinot Gris (California),"Completely stainless-fermented and aged, this is a blockbuster of a white wine, refreshing and exotic in floral intoxication. Dry and light-bodied, it offers an edginess of slate-like minerality along with aromas of apricot and peach, finishing in a dusting of white pepper.",92
Roger Voss,Luis Duarte 2013 Monte de Carrapatelo Colheita Seleccionada Tinto Red (Alentejano),"This is a new wine from the hands of master winemaker Luis Duarte. With its rich black fruits and dense tannins, it's also a wine that is firmly structured. Wood aging has added a layer of complexity and broadened out the fruits and dark tannins. Drink from 2017.",92
Virginie Boone,Melhill 2012 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"Creamy in texture and floral in aroma, this is a lovely and well-integrated white wine, with well-crafted characteristics of pear and honeyed apple. Medium bodied, it'll pair well at the table and on its own.",92
Matt Kettmann,Niner 2013 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"Boosted by 5% Petit Verdot, this bottling shows lush aromas of fudge, black plum, black currant, soy and black pepper. The palate is dense and thick with more black fruit as well as caramel, purple flowers, milk chocolate and mint-chip ice cream, proving concentrated and decadent.",92
Paul Gregutt,Purple Hands 2014 Freedom Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Pommard and Wädenswil clones are combined here, yielding a stylish, well-defined wine with spicy berry fruit. Flavors punch through into a deep and detailed finish, with streaks of cola and caramel. The balance is spot-on.",92
Roger Voss,Quinta da Lagoalva de Cima 2013 Lagoalva Barrel Selection Tinto Red (Tejo),"As its name suggests this is a selection of barrels of Syrah and Touriga Nacional. It is rich, smooth and full of ripe fruit. The dusty tannins are in suspension, backing up the black plum and blueberry fruit flavors. Along with the juicy acidity, this is a wine to age. Drink from 2017.",92
Roger Voss,Quinta do Monte Xisto 2013 Red (Douro),"This is an impressive, powerful wine. It speaks of the hard landscape of the Douro Superior, with its structure and dark tannins. At the same time, ripe dark fruits push through the still-young tannins giving the potential for a rich, black fruit dominated wine. Predominantly Touriga Nacional (60 percent), this wine is a new venture created by João Nicolau d'Almeida (who has run Ramos-Pinto for many years) and his family. Drink from 2018.",92
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Reichsgraf von Kesselstatt 2014 Brauneberger Juffer-Sonnenuhr Spätlese Grosse Lage Riesling (Mosel),"A spray of rose petals perfumes this aromatic spätlese. Its freshness is exhilarating, contrasting lavish layers of honey and marmalade against the sharp bites of pineapple, tangerine and lemon. Cutting and spry, yet deeply penetrating, it finishes on a lingering pollen note.",92
Virginie Boone,Stone The Crows 2013 Three Twins Vineyard Fallen Feather Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"With a smidgen of Petit Verdot, this dark, tight and leathery wine is exalted in tobacco, graphite and tar, still youthfully awkward and shy. The flavors lean savory into meaty aspects of currant and clove, waiting to find companionship in fruit. Drink now after a decant, or cellar through 2023.",92
Kerin O’Keefe,Sturm 2014 Sauvignon (Collio),"You'll find aromas of tomato leaf, passion fruit, crushed rock and green bell pepper on this radiant white. The bright, savory palate delivers tropical fruit, tangerine zest, dill, celery and mineral alongside tangy acidity. It's an extremely impressive showing for this challenging vintage.",92
Anne Krebiehl MW,Kuentz-Bas 2014 Pfersigberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"Subtle notes of clean, fresh lemon zest promise pleasure, the palate reveals a far riper aspect of fresh red apple and baked apples. The dry palate remains zingy and clean and provides ample textured freshness. The effect is that of fresh apple sorbet.",92
Joe Czerwinski,Plantagenet 2014 Riesling (Great Southern),"Based on this example and a few other informal tastings, 2014 will be a top vintage for Rieslings from Western Australia. Aromas of lime sherbet and wet stone lead into a crisply focused palate loaded with citrusy tartness that lingers on the mouthwatering finish. Drink now with shellfish, and consider holding some for up to 10 years.",92
Matt Kettmann,Scratch 2013 Grenache (Arroyo Seco),"Reserved red-cherry fruit aromas gain complexity with fog-soaked sagebrush, dried purple flowers and an earthy mushroom character on the nose. Roasted shiitake, marjoram, crushed Brazil nuts and a hint of cardamom play on the dark, spicy, earthy palate, laid across a bed of cranberry fruit.",92
Anne Krebiehl MW,Sipp Mack 2014 Rosacker Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"Freshly cut red, yellow and green apples make both nose and palate very fruity. The dry palate with its lemony freshness and open aspect lets all the apple flavors shine and inflects them here and there with baked and dried apple, too. Wonderfully fruity and pure.",92
Jim Gordon,St. Amant 2013 Lodi Native Marian's Vineyard Zinfandel (Mokelumne River),"This is one of the best balanced and most elegant Zins around. Very fresh in aroma, it's slightly yeasty like freshly fermented wine, and with subtly gorgeous cherry and blackberry flavors layered with light cedar and cocoa spiciness. Not only is the finish lingering, but the wine still tasted great two days after pulling the cork.",92
Paul Gregutt,Stoller 2013 Nancy's Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"This cuvée is made with the oldest Pommard clones in the estate vineyard. It's a sharp-edged, reserve-level wine with a defining streak of peppery herb. The black fruits and barrel flavors of licorice, espresso and dark chocolate promise further depth as it ages. Drink 2020–2030.",92
Lauren Buzzeo,Fable Mountain 2011 Night Sky Red (Coastal Region),"The 2011 Night Sky shows more earthy character than the 2012, as upfront aromas of soil, blackberry leaf and pepper are grounded by ripe fruit tones of black currant, plum and mulberry. Medium weight on the palate, with velvety tannins that grip through the long, spicy finish. The dense, tight mouthfeel, firm structure and overall balance suggest this wine will age well through 2022.",92
Virginie Boone,Vine Cliff 2013 Chardonnay (Los Carneros),"This full-bodied wine has a voluptuous entry that's slightly tropical in pineapple and Asian pear, as well as vanilla-layered oak. The expansive beginning segues smoothly into a higher-wire act of minerality, finishing fleshy and fresh.",90
Sean P. Sullivan,Va Piano 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This wine brings aromas of blackberry, dates and spice. The palate displays abundant cherry flavors with lightly chalky tannins.",90
Virginie Boone,Y Rousseau 2012 Le Roi Soleil Cabernet Sauvignon (Mount Veeder),"Syrupy thick at first, decadent enough for a king, this rich red is defined by vanilla French toast and blackberry jam aromas and flavors. It finds balance midway through on the palate, veering into crisper red tones of cranberry and rhubarb. Time will help mellow things out. Cellar through 2020.",90
Jim Gordon,Monte Volpe 2013 Pinot Grigio (Mendocino),"Livelier than usual in texture and popping with bright citrus aromas and flavors, this light-bodied and barrel-fermented wine is a great palate-cleanser and will pair beautifully with dishes like raw oysters and herbed goat cheese. It smells and tastes like lemon, lime, green apple and kiwi, and has great balance.",90
Kerin O’Keefe,Palladino 2011 Ornato  (Barolo),"Aromas of red berry, rose and cake spices lead the way on this ripe, forward Barolo. The round palate offers black cherry, raspberry, licorice and white pepper alongside polished tannins. It's already extremely accessible, so don't leave it in the cellar for too long. Drink 2016–2021.",90
Virginie Boone,Paradise Ridge 2012 Rockpile Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rockpile),"Ripe black cherry and vanilla swirl around notes of cedar and dusty tannins, combining seamlessly on the palate. From an appellation not known for the variety, it does justice to mountain fruit and power, finishing with substance.",90
Kerin O’Keefe,Pecchenino 2013 Siri d'Jermu  (Dogliani Superiore),"This structured Dolcetto offers aromas of blue- and black-skinned fruit, violet, chopped herbs and kitchen spices. The vibrant palate delivers black cherry, black currant, clove, tobacco and anise while firm, refined tannins provide the framework.",90
Kerin O’Keefe,Poderi Colla 2013 Costa Bruna  (Barbera d'Alba),"Fruity aromas of mature berry mingle with notes of dark cooking spice and chopped herbs on this savory, medium-bodied red. The round, concentrated palate offers juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, clove and tobacco framed in firm acidity and a velvety texture.",90
Sean P. Sullivan,Poet's Leap 2014 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This warm-vintage wine is more aromatically reticent than recent vintages, with notes of stone fruit, slate and mineral. It drinks a hair off dry, with depth to the lightly spritzy fruit flavors and razor-sharp acidity.",90
Michael Schachner,Rafael Cambra 2012 Soplo Garnacha Tintorera (Valencia),"Perfumed plum and raspberry aromas are slightly earthy and leathery. This is medium-to-full in body, with smooth, chunky tannins. Earthy, lightly baked plum and wild-berry flavors finish loamy and expansive. Drink through 2017.",90
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Raphael 2014 Virgin Berry Riesling (North Fork of Long Island),"While dry in style, this lithe, delicately framed Riesling packs a punch of ripe, rich tropical fruit. It's blossomy and buoyantly fruity, yet brashly mineral as well. Made using “virgin berries”, uniquely seedless grapes with a tendency towards exuberant aroma and flavor concentration.",90
Sean P. Sullivan,Seven Hills 2013 McClellan Estate Vineyard Malbec (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"All varietal, this wine offers unique aromas of toast, fig, dried herb and exotic spice. The purple fruit flavors are deft in style with a pleasing sense of balance, length and texture.",90
Sean P. Sullivan,Snoqualmie 2013 Eco Made with Organic Grapes Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Dark berry, herb and fig aromas lead to dense, full and palate-coating dark fruit flavors. It checks all the boxes for varietal correctness, concentration and value.",90
Virginie Boone,Stags' Leap Winery 2012 Petite Sirah (Napa Valley),"The winery's larger bottling of the variety, one it has mastered for decades, this wine is a mix of baked plum and rustic leather notes. It's softly tannic, with pronounced jolts of tobacco and black pepper. With small amounts of other Rhône varieties, from Syrah to Viognier, it meanders to the finish, with a distinct trace of minerality.",90
Anna Lee C. Iijima,The Grapes of Roth 2014 Dry Riesling (Long Island),"Similarly to it's Virgin Berry sibling, Roth's regular label Dry Riesling has a distinctly green, woodsy tone lending an alpine feel to sweet-tart peach and apricot flavors. It's brisk and fine-footed, yet zesty tangerine and grapefruit acidity persist long on the finish.",90
Jim Gordon,The Withers Winery 2013 Charles Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"This is a full-bodied and full-flavored wine with rich and deep aromas, ripe fruit flavors and a texture that feels substantial but polished. It starts with black cherry and woodsy aromas, then goes to lively but broad cherry, plum and nutmeg notes. The finish stays flavorful and dry.",90
Virginie Boone,Truchard 2012 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Carneros),"From a knoll in Carneros, oft thought of as chilly for Cabernet, this wine exhibits cooler aspects of the variety, from pencil lead and cedar to dried herb. It is complemented by fruitier characteristics of cassis and plum, finishing in dusty, structured tannins. Cellar through 2017–2020.",90
Virginie Boone,Acacia 2013 Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Smoky cinnamon and nutmeg pierce the entry of this wine, a dense, full-bodied expression of place. Layers of rich cherry and strawberry lie over classic varietal earthiness, finishing medium in length.",90

Michelle 2012 Canoe Ridge Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills),"This wine is aromatically reserved with notes of milk chocolate, char, berry, barrel spices and high-toned herbs. It's silky and polished in feel, with richness and elegance to the coffee flavors.",90
Virginie Boone,Cobb 2012 Emmaline Ann Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This wine pushes the notion of low alcohol, giving soft and subtle an extreme definition. As such, it will not please everyone. Earthy spice and an exotic notion of orange blossom dance around a light, clear body and high-toned minerality. It hails from a foggy, shaded vineyard in Freestone.",90
Kerin O’Keefe,Comm. G. B. Burlotto 2011 Acclivi  (Barolo),"This opens with aromas of underbrush, leather, berry and a balsamic note. The forward palate offers dried cherry, white pepper, tobacco and the warmth of alcohol alongside firm tannins. Drink this sooner rather than later.",90
Matt Kettmann,Cooper-Garrod 2012 Gravel Ridge Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Straw-yellow in the glass, this wine from organically grown, nearly 35-year-old vines shows iodine, citrus pith, yogurt and seared lemon peels in the restrained, minerally nose.

On the nose, it shows chopped fresh mint, rose blossoms, fennel, black cherries and teriyaki beef jerky. Black pepper and soy mark the palate, along with blackberry juice and a slate-driven minerality.",91
Anne Krebiehl MW,Nittnaus Hans und Christine 2013 Nit'ana Red (Burgenland),"Still closed, this is redolent of the elegant, nutty notes of new French oak which nonetheless complement the ripe but supple cherry fruit. The tannins are superfine and the addition of peppery Zweigelt to this Cabernet-Merlot blend lends spice and verve to the mix. This was made for the long run, so give it some bottle age and allow it to meld into its elegant self. Drink from 2018.",91
Jim Gordon,Nottingham Cellars 2012 Ghielmetti Vineyard Micro-lot Reserve Malbec (Livermore Valley),"This deep-colored, full-bodied red gets a little swagger in its step from enticing smoky oak aromas and powerful black-fruit flavors that also carry that spicy oak streak. This is brash enough for slow-cooked barbecue but sophisticated enough for osso buco. The texture is fine-grained from supportive tannin, and the finish lingers. Best now through 2018.",91
Kerin O’Keefe,Poggio Argentiera 2012 Capatosta  (Morellino di Scansano),"Made with Sangiovese blended with 10% Ciliegiolo and 5% Alicante Bouschet, this savory wine opens with aromas of underbrush, ripe berry, tobacco leaf and Mediterranean herb. The vibrant, refined palate doles out juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, orange peel, licorice and white pepper alongside supple tannins. It closes on a mineral note. Enjoy through 2020.",91
Virginie Boone,Pride Mountain 2012 Cabernet Franc (Sonoma County),"Although the fine mountain site straddles both Napa and Sonoma, this wine's fruit is all Sonoma, the bulk of it Cabernet Franc, with 17% Cabernet Sauvignon. Dried cranberry shows on the nose and palate, followed by chalky tannins and a refined use of oak, finishing in a bite of currant and cherry. Enjoy through 2017.",91
Lauren Buzzeo,Reyneke 2013 Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Stellenbosch),"This is a well-balanced, well-structured white wine that's sure to evolve through 2020, at least. It's certainly attractive now, with subtle toasty notes of sweet spice and wood-grilled apple alongside hints of kiwi, sweet grass, green plum and lime. The medium-weight palate offers ample acidity and a streak of minerality that keeps things fresh and lifted through the softly spiced finish.",91
Kerin O’Keefe,Ruffino 2010 Riserva Ducale Oro Gran Selezione  (Chianti Classico),"Aromas of violet, iris, forest floor, woodland berry and allspice lead the nose on this structured, savory wine. The concentrated palate delivers ripe black cherry, mocha, clove, tobacco and licorice alongside velvety tannins and fresh acidity. It's firm and well balanced.",91
Joe Czerwinski,Saint Clair 2014 Pioneer Block 20 Dillons Point Cash Block Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"The Dillons Point subregion of Marlborough often produces particularly pungent examples of Sauvignon Blanc, but this wine doesn't quite hew to that mold. The herbal notes are prominent but well mannered, backed by plenty of mild citrus—think white grapefruit—and melon. Ample weight, a silky texture and a lengthy finish complete the package.",91
Anne Krebiehl MW,Soellner 2014 von Gösing Roter Veltliner (Wagram),"Lively notes of fresh yellow plum and mandarin open up into a friendly, fresh palate that combines rich fruit and zingy citrus to great effect. The result is lip-smacking freshness with lots of midpalate concentration and zing.",91
Sean P. Sullivan,Woodinville Wine Cellars 2012 Little Bear Creek Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Aromas of dark chocolate, dried and fresh herbs, raspberries and black cherry predominate on this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec. Creamy, rich and focused, it has a pleasing sense of texture and vanilla flavors that carry across the finish. It's truly a standout wine at this price.",91
Lauren Buzzeo,Kanonkop 2012 Estate Wine Pinotage (Simonsberg-Stellenbosch),"This classic, iconic Pinotage opens with dense aromas of pressed purple violets, forest berries, raspberry sauce and fudge brownie. The lush and decadent palate offers more of the same, with a crushed velvet texture and final notes of licorice and toasted spice that linger long. It's delicious now, but should hold well through 2022.",91
Michael Schachner,El Enemigo 2012 Bonarda (Mendoza),"Intriguing aromas of lavender, hoja santa and green tobacco blend nicely with blackberry and blueberry scents. This top-flight Bonarda feels lush and only moderately tannic. Blackberry, leather and mild briny flavors finish minty and lightly herbal. Drink now.",91
Roger Voss,Château d'Esclans 2013 Les Clans Rosé (Côtes de Provence),"Always released after a further year's aging, this rich and full-bodied wine is now at its peak. With a dense texture, layers of spice and vanilla as well as intense red fruits, this powerful wine expresses the more complex side of Provence rosé. Drink now.",91
Roger Voss,Château Riotor 2014 Rosé (Côtes de Provence),"Produced by the owners of Châteauneuf-du-Pape estate Château Mont-Redon, this is a full and fruity wine. It has a good balance between acidity and red berry fruits that give a rich character. Packed with flavor, it's ready to drink.",91
Roger Voss,Château Sainte Marguerite 2014 Rosé (Côtes de Provence),"While the wine is really pale in color, it does have a great range of flavors, offering red fruit notes balanced by beautiful acidity and citrus streaks. It's gently textured, giving a good bite to the fruitiness at the end.",91
Roger Voss,Château Vignelaure 2014 Rosé (Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence),"This rich and impressive wine has structure and a firm texture, partly from the Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend (45% Grenache, 35% Syrah, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon). It is dense and full of juicy red fruits, caramel and delicious spice. Production is only 2,500 cases. It would be worth aging for a few more months, so drink from late 2015.",91
Joe Czerwinski,Cloudy Bay 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"Classic gooseberry and pink grapefruit notes feature gentle herbal nuances on the nose. There's ample weight and texture on the palate, with a burst of mouthwatering citrus on the finish.",91
Roger Voss,Domaine de la Bastide Blanche 2014 TwoB Rosé (Côtes de Provence),"Very fruity and fresh, this wine has crisp apples as well as red fruit giving it a bright, delicious feeling. The acidity goes right through the wine, giving a beautifully fresh feel that points up the fragrant raspberries. Vineyards are in the heart of the sandy soils of the Saint Tropez peninsula.",91
Roger Voss,Domaine du Grand Cros 2014 L'Esprit de Provence Rosé (Côtes de Provence),"Rounded and soft, this rich rosé is fruity while also perfumed. The blending of Syrah in the mix gives the wine a sense of power and concentration, making it an adquate partner at the dinner table.",91
Roger Voss,Domaine Sainte-Marie 2014 VieVité Extraordinaire Rosé (Côtes de Provence),"This wine is full in the mouth with a taste between pepper and fruit. It's ripe, rounded and tangy with clementine zest as well crisp apples and red currants. It could benefit from a few months in bottle, so drink from late 2015.",91
Virginie Boone,Dry Creek Vineyard 2012 DCV2 Estate Four Clones Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Only the second vintage of this vineyard-designate wine from an estate property, this bottling offers spicy cherry, black tea and dried herb, backed by oaky backbone and structure. Dark chocolate and leather play on the palate in subtle waves, hitting their strides on the finish. Cellar through 2020.",91
Joe Czerwinski,Dry River 2013 Pinot Noir (Martinborough),"As typical for Dry River Pinots, this one is pretty surly in its youth. Intense and astringent, it packs layers of dusty black-cherry fruit into a tightly coiled frame. Try after 2019.",91
Virginie Boone,Dutton Estate 2013 Cohen Vineyard Dutton Ranch Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),"Floral and herbal from the get-go, this medium-bodied white from a great vineyard offers a lot to like. Stainless-steel fermentation gives it a lean underbelly, rounded out by sharp Meyer lemon and tangerine, buoyed by mouthwatering acidity. Green apple and an accent of honey peak on the finish.",91
Virginie Boone,Failla 2013 Keefer Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Light in color and weight, this vineyard-designate conveys a wealth of rose petals, earth and bright, crisp red cherry. Compellingly layered and shy, it defines the term ethereal. The finish is medium in length and accented in spicy cardamom.",91
Virginie Boone,Friedeman 2013 Dichotomy Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This wine combines fruit from both cool and warm sites, which in the vintage might have both leaned on the warmer side. Black fruit and licorice give it a burly character at first. Decanting or letting the wine open in the glass will help, but still it retains smooth, velvety tannins and resolved oak.",91
Joe Czerwinski,Akarua 2012 Bannockburn Pinot Noir (Central Otago),"Alluring notes of Asian five spice and wet stone frame ripe cherry aromas in this medium-bodied wine. The texture is firm, becoming faintly dusty on the finish, but the wine is approachable now for its cherry fruit and appealing damp clay quality. Drink now–2018.",91
Michael Schachner,Benvenuto de la Serna 2010 Trisagio Malbec-Petit Verdot-Tannat Red (Valle de Uco),"Sweet oak and vanilla aromas are front and center on a jammy bouquet that also features black plum and blackberry scents. This blend of Malbec, Petit Verdot and Tannat feels full, lifted and balanced. Ripe, enticing flavors of wild berry and cassis are backed by toast, chocolate, vanilla and coconut notes as well as heat and burn. Drink through 2019.",91
Joe Czerwinski,Carrick 2013 Unravelled Pinot Noir (Central Otago),"Even Carrick's entry-level wine has turned out well in 2013, offering a sturdy, robust mouthful of dark fruit. Plum, espresso and dark chocolate mingle on the nose and palate, while the finish is long, faintly dusty and mouthwatering. Drink 2017–2025.",91
Roger Voss,JCB 2014 No. 5 Rosé (Côtes de Provence),"An addition to the worldwide JCB brand, produced by the Boisset family of Burgundy, this feels rich and sumptuous, full of ripe red fruits and juicy plums. It is also balanced and well structured. Drink this wine with food.",91
Roger Voss,Casca Wines 2015 Bote Chardonnay-Fernão Pires-Vital White (Lisboa),"Heading nicely in the crisp and aromatic direction, this is a light and bright wine. It has a citrus flavor that is balanced by richer pear and plum fruits. The wine is ready to drink.",85
Roger Voss,Cave de Viré 2015 Grande Réserve du Président  (Mâcon-Villages),"This soft wine has a gentle texture and smooth white fruits. It is fruity and lightly perfumed. With its crisp edge of acidity, is totally ready to drink.",85
Roger Voss,Cortes de Cima 2015 Rosé (Alentejano),"Onion skin orange in color, this is a full and fat wine. It has attractive red-berry fruit and just the right amount of acidity to keep it fresh and crisp. Drink now.",85
Michael Schachner,Domaine Bousquet 2015 Cabernet Sauvignon (Tupungato),"Saucy berry and tea aromas are herbal, earthy and stewed. This feels full but syrupy. Flavors of cooked berry, molasses and mocha finish sweet and soupy, with only a touch of acidic offset.",85
Michael Schachner,Mendel 2015 Semillon (Mendoza),"Mushy citrus and papaya aromas are waxy and lack pop. Angular and lemony in feel, this varietal white offers a one-note flavor profile based on lemon. A ringing, citric finish affords for a hint of tropical fruit.",85
Roger Voss,Messias 2015 Santola White (Vinho Verde),"In a medium sweet style, the wine has a light prickle and fine citrus acidity to balance the soft freshness. It is a refreshing wine, totally drinkable immediately.",85
Alexander Peartree,Mont Sec 2015 Mont Sec Vineyards Viognier (Texas),"Peach, banana peel and a slight petrol note show mildly on the nose. The round palate boasts tart peach, pineapple rind and bitter lemon zest.",85
Kerin O’Keefe,Paolo Manzone 2012 Meriame  (Barolo),"This has aromas that recall leafy underbrush, sawdust and menthol. The dense, oak-driven palate shows licorice, espresso, toast and a hint of bitter chocolate but the fruit has dried up. It abruptly ends on a green note of powdered sage.",85
Roger Voss,Quinta de Paços 2015 Casa de Paços Rosé (Vinho Verde),"A rose pink colored wine that is dry and with ripe fruit. Its acidity contrasts with the warm red-berry fruit and the edge of tannin. There is a peppery, crisp aftertaste.",85
Paul Gregutt,Rascal 2014 Pinot Noir (Oregon),"Light strawberry fruit carries an undertone of dried grass. It turns a little sour in the mouth, but it's fine for the price.",85
Michael Schachner,Terrazas de Los Andes 2015 Reserva Torrontés (Salta),"Initial aromas of lychee and jasmine are varietally correct but this struggles to stay fresh and instead turns oily on the nose. A mid-level palate holds nectarine, lychee and oily flavors that turn bitter on the finish.",85
Roger Voss,Herdade Grande 2015 Audaz Branco White (Alentejano),"The wine is ripe with apple and creamed pear flavors. It is warm, rich and missing acidity. There is an attractive almond and spice character to this ripe wine. Drink now.",85
Jim Gordon,Jack's House 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"This wine looks, smells and tastes on the light side. Herb and red-cherry aromas precede rather lean flavors from cherry to clove and dill, and a brisk texture with some tannic grip.",85
Lauren Buzzeo,Kiwi Cuvée 2014 Bin 068 Chardonnay (Vin de France),"Here is a simple but tasty Chard, offering attractive notes of pear, spiced orange and toasted apple skin on the nose and mouth. It's light weight and well balanced, with ample acidity and a short but clean finish. Enjoy now.",85

Roger Voss,Domaine Poulleau Père et Fils 2014  Chorey-lès-Beaune,"This wine is extracted and tough. The acidity does come through to help out, although it still has a hard edge with some bitter toast. It will soften, leaving some perfumed fruit for the future.",85
Michael Schachner,Durigutti 2014 Bonarda (Mendoza),"Raisiny and earthy on the nose, this Bonarda also offers damp aromas of fern and tobacco. Chunky, with a soft, flat palate, this tastes raisiny and stewed. Low acidity and raisiny flavors on the finish are consistent with what came before.",85
Michael Schachner,El Esteco 2015 Don David Reserve Torrontés (Calchaquí Valley),"Oily, gritty aromas of almond skins set up a pungent but oily tasting palate. Core fruit flavors lean towards sour grapefruit and orange, while the finish is tangy, salty and sour through the last note.",85
Matt Kettmann,Felten Cellars 2013 Tempranillo (Paso Robles),"A rare miss for this winery, this bottling shows cooked red cherries, dust, vanilla and caramel on the somewhat hollow nose. The palate is almost overly rich with caramelized black cherry, fudge and chalky tannins. Patience will likely improve this one.",85
Roger Voss,Wines & Winemakers 2015 Casa Ermelinda Freitas Monte de Baía Rosé (Península de Setúbal),"This raspberry-flavored wine is soft and ripe. While it is fruity, it also has a nutty character that gives it a rich taste. It's dry and in a style that will make it better with food than by itself.",85
Michael Schachner,Lagarde 2013 Henry Legarde Malbec (Luján de Cuyo),"Roasted, stewed berry aromas are rustic and suggestive of grilled meat. This is high in acidity, and thus it feels sharp and edgy. Flavors of forced oak, related spice and tart plum end with a scraping, tannic feel and herbal berry flavors.",85
Kerin O’Keefe,Marchesi di Barolo 2009 Riserva  (Barolo),"Roasted coffee bean and menthol aromas lead the nose while the evolved palate offers dark bitter chocolate, licorice and a toasted note. Showing the heat of the vintage, the fruit has largely dried up while astringent tannins lead to a bracing finish.",85
Alexander Peartree,McPherson 2014 Sangiovese (Texas),"There seems to be a dusty veil over the fruit of this sold, approachable Sangiovese. A bit of sweet spice creeps up on the palate, making it enjoyable by itself or paired alongside pizza Tuesday.",85
Roger Voss,Patriarche Père et Fils 2014  Coteaux Bourguignons,This light and fruity wine offers soft tannins and an earthy character. The wine comes mainly from Beaujolais with 15% of Pinot Noir from the Mâcon region. Drink now.,85
Roger Voss,Paul Reitz 2014  Saint-Véran,"This wine has acidity and a good balance between the fresh, crisp character and the richer yellow fruits. It is ready to drink.",85
Virginie Boone,Pech Merle 2013 Treborce Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Ripe plum and plenty of vanilla and cherry provide the perception of sweetness in this wine. That sensation may stem from the pushing-the-envelope generosity of the ripe fruit or from the oak. or both. It makes for a full-bodied, heady experience.",85
Kerin O’Keefe,Punset 2011 Campo Quadro Riserva  (Barbaresco),"This opens with unusual aromas that recall minestrone soup, celery and glazed onion that carry over to the palate. It lacks fruit richness and is rather muddled, offering flavors reminiscent of sweet and sour sauce. Tasted both bottles, same notes.",85
Roger Voss,Ribafreixo 2015 Pato Frio Antão Vaz (Alentejo),"The grape is local to the Vidigueira region of the southern Alentejo. Coming from cool vineyards, the wine has a fresh character that is balanced by the ripe melon and juicy pear fruits. It has a crisper end and is ready to drink.",85
Joe Czerwinski,Jacob's Creek 2015 Classic Pinot Grigio (South Eastern Australia),"Melon and citrus aromas and flavors mingle easily in this cleanly made quaffer. It's a bit plump on the palate, yet refreshing on the lemon-lime finish.",85
,William Knuttel 2007 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"A nice Pinot Noir, dry and elegant, and if it's somewhat one-dimensional, it packs a lot of flavor. With rich raspberry, red licorice, bacon and spice flavors, it's a lovely wine to drink now.",87
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Casa Larga 2008 Fiori Delle Stelle Ice Wine Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes),"The sweet scent of raspberry and strawberry preserves waft from this Cab Franc icewine from Casa Larga. On the palate as well, there's a nice concentration of preserved berry flavors that soar on the palate with a bright, sunny acidity. Finishes clean and long with just a hint of autumn leaves and bramble.",87
Roger Voss,Cave de Beblenheim 2009 Baron de Hoen Riesling (Alsace),"A soft style of Riesling, with some attractive aromatic white flower character. The fruit is soft, just off dry, freshened by acidity. Screwcap.",87
,De Loach 2008 Thornton Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Soft and appealing, this Pinot offers lush, elaborate flavors of raspberry and cherry pie filling, mocha and sandalwood flavors, finished with sweet, dusty Indian spices. It's made for drinking now.",87
Michael Schachner,De Martino 2010 347 Vineyards Sauvignon Blanc (Central Valley),"A little hard at first, with match stick aromas. After that blows off, there's green fruit notes carrying the nose. Full in the mouth, with acidic cut and spunky flavors of nectarine and orange. Finishes round, with citrus and passion fruit.",87
Roger Voss,Dopff Au Moulin 2009 Gewürztraminer (Alsace),"Blowsy, lychee aromas, a wine that is ripe, soft, open, with a light touch of acidity. Pepper and sweet spices fit well into this easy profile. Screwcap.",87
,Center of Effort 2008 Effort Chardonnay (Edna Valley),"With brisk Edna Valley acidity and intensely pure Chardonnay fruit flavors of tangerines, limes and sweet Meyer lemon sour candy, this is a pleasant sipper with roasted or grilled salmon, or a barbecue chicken or pork skewer with pineapples, green peppers and onions.",87
Michael Schachner,El Coto 2010 Viura (Rioja),"Pulpy and also minerally on the nose, with basic white fruit aromas. Zesty, crisp and defined by slate and lime in the mouth, with apple, lime and dryness to the flavor profile. A composed little white wine for simple sipping or white sangria.",87
,Handley 2009 Gewürztraminer (Anderson Valley),"Shows the perfect balance and varietal richness that Anderson Valley Gewürztraminers are known for. With crisp acidity, it has exotic flavors of Asian pears, candied pears, tangerines, gingersnap cookies and dusty spices, with a dry finish. Would score much higher if it were more concentrated.",87
,Kuleto Estate 2008 Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"A good, rich, flashy Zinfandel. There's not much to get excited about, but it delivers Zin's personality in a most attractive way. It's spicy, rich and sweet in cherry, raspberry, cocoa, honey and spice flavors.",87
,Lane Tanner 2009 Julia's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Funky, with mushroom and sweaty leather aromas that can best be described as Burgundian. But it's richly sweet in raspberries and cherries, and the smoky oak is nicely integrated with the fruit. A pleasant Pinot Noir to drink now.",87

Virginie Boone,"Monte De Oro 2006 Reserve, Vista del Monte Vineyard Syrah (Temecula Valley)","A big burly Syrah from this Temecula producer whose goal it is to become the premier winery of Southern California, the wine is loaded with plummy black fruit and a peppery mouthfeel, its oakiness derived from the almost three years it spent barrel-aging in new French oak. Not for the meek at 15.6% alcohol, it finishes a tad sweet.",87
,Mounts 2008 Estate Grown Syrah (Dry Creek Valley),"The blackberry, blueberry, bacon, pepper and sandalwood flavors are nice, and the wine finishes dry. A good, rich Syrah for drinking now if you're looking for a full-bodied and tannic red wine. Give it a brief decant.",87
Michael Schachner,Ninquén 2009 Antu Cabernet Sauvignon-Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),"Cola, root beer and other earthy aromas open up this full-bodied blend of 70% Cabernet and 30% Carmenère. The palate shows pointed, prickly acidity and flavors of black cherry and cassis. Offers a rich flavor profile but the acidity creates bite and sharpness.",87
Michael Schachner,Oro de Castilla 2010 Solo Verdejo (Rueda),"Round and good by Rueda standards, with melon and peach aromas but not too much citrus. The palate is full and chunky, with papaya, melon and a touch of pithy bitterness. More regular than special, but good and goes down easy before finishing dry.",87
Michael Schachner,Pablo del Villar 2010 Ipsum Verdejo-Viura (Rueda),"White fruits, flower blossom and a touch of brine work the nose, which is followed by flush, semisweet apple, gooseberry and lime flavors. More sweet than outright tangy, but still citrusy and zesty. Holds form on the crisp finish. 60% Verdejo and 40% Viura.",87
,Pax 2007 Cuvée Christine Syrah (North Coast),"A touch overripe, showing some bitter, dried raisinskin notes. If you can get past that, you'll find plenty of rich blackberry, dark chocolate, plum, beef jerky and black pepper flavors.",87
,Robert Foley 2008 The Griffin Red (Napa Valley),"Ripe enough in blackberries, currants and mocha, with an earthy, tobacco herbaceousness. The tannins are potent, making the wine hard. Drink now, after a good decanting.",87
Joe Czerwinski,42°S 2008 Pinot Noir (Tasmania),"Light, fresh and silky—just what might be expected from cool-climate Pinot Noir. A pleasant earthiness underscores prettily interwoven strands of herbs and cherries. It's exciting to see the burgeoning quality of the wines coming out of Tasmania.",87
Michael Schachner,Manyana 2008 Tempranillo (Cariñena),"Aromas of red licorice candy and raspberry are fruity, forward and clean. The palate is more than competent and balanced, with creamy strawberry and raspberry flavors. The finish is short but easy, and for the price that's all you can ask for.",87
Joe Czerwinski,McWilliam's Hanwood Estate 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (South Eastern Australia),"A good value in easy-to-drink Cabernet, McWilliam's 2008 is plummy and chocolaty, with soft tannins and a velvety finish. A bit simple perhaps, but definitely satisfying. Drink now.",87

Roger Voss,G. H. Mumm NV Mumm de Cramant Blanc de Blancs Chardonnay (Champagne),"Now with its intensity and some bottle age, this wine—formerly known as Crémant de Cramant—is rich, with its apple flavor blending with an almond note and a soft, warm texture. The acidity shoots right through this ripe wine.",92
,Iron Horse 2007 Ocean Reserve Sparkling (Green Valley),"A beautiful sparkling wine that shows the Iron Horse signature of balanced elegance. The lime, raspberry, vanilla and brioche flavors are rich and intricate, but particularly lovely is the texture, which is soft and silky.",92
Roger Voss,Jean Milan NV Grande Réserve Blanc de Blancs Grand Cru Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),"Fight your way through the string and wax sealing that holds down the cork, and you'll discover a wine that is rich, full and opulent. The ripe peach character is balanced with the delicious toasty edge and final bright acidity. Ready to drink.",92
Roger Voss,Monte da Penha 2005 Grande Reserva Red (Alentejo),"Powerful and concentrated, this is just at its peak. Ripe, rich fruit and tarry tannins give it freshness and a dry core. It's solid and serious, a dense wine that calls for equally rich food. Drink it now while it's at its prime.",92
Paul Gregutt,Patton Valley 2010 Lorna Marie Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"The Lorna Marie is the winery's reserve, and it has exceptional concentration and depth. Berry and cherry dominate, spiced up with a pumpkin pie accent. Round, rich and full, yet moderate in alcohol, this is a fine expression of Oregon Pinot Noir in a challenging vintage.",92
Paul Gregutt,Patton Valley 2010 West Block Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"All the 2010 Patton Valley Pinots are significantly lower in alcohol than the previous vintage, and it works to their advantage. Nuanced fruit flavors include rhubarb and tart cherry, with veins of cola and dark chocolate adding further complexity. Its length is excellent.",92
Roger Voss,Pierre Gimonnet et Fils 2005 Oenophile Premier Cru Blanc de Blancs Extra Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),"The extra age on this bone-dry wine has paid off, as the taut character of a young wine has been tempered with toast, creating a round feeling. It is perfectly in harmony now, beautiful and crisp.",92
,Scubla 2008 Cràtis Verduzzo (Colli Orientali del Friuli),"Verduzzo is a very interesting grape that tends to exude oxidized aromas of candied fruit, butterscotch and carmel. But when made well, as in the case of this selection, it offers power, concentration and natural richness as well.",92
Paul Gregutt,Adelsheim 2010 Winderlea Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"The Winderlea is perhaps the most unique in terms of style and flavor among all the 2010 Adelsheim single-vineyard Pinots. Its distinctive minerality accompanies tart cranberry and cherry notes, citrusy acidity with a splash of grapefruit flavor, and a finish that tastes of coffee and tea. Complex and long, this is a wine that will surely spark some heated discussion.",92
Roger Voss,Bruno Paillard 2002 Assemblage Brut  (Champagne),"This is a powerful, almost concentrated, very dry selection. Its richness comes from the weight of its fruit flavors and the tight tang of its intense acidity. From a fine vintage, it could still age for several more years. Disgorged July 2011.",92
,Castello d'Albola 2003  Vin Santo del Chianti Classico,"Thanks to eight years in Vin Santo's traditional caratelli barrels, this sweet blend of Trebbiano and Malvasia offers a dark, golden-amber color, bearing intense aromas of dried apricot, candied fruit, honey and toasted almond.",92
,Ferrari 2001 Giulio Ferrari Riserva del Fondatore Chardonnay (Trento),"A landmark wine for those who love Italian sparklers, this shows loads of ripe apricot, melon and honey notes, with toasted nut and baked bread hints in the background.

This great Zinfandel is a joy to drink.",92
Roger Voss,Quinta do Sagrado 2008 VT '08 Red (Douro),"This mature wine has a soft, smooth character and ripe fruit. With its red-berry flavors and gentle tannins, it's very ready to drink. The blend is dominated by Touriga Nacional from an estate at the heart of the Douro vineyards in Pinhão.",90
Michael Schachner,San Pedro de Yacochuya 2012 Red (Salta),"This is a highly particular, funky blend of 85% Malbec and 15% Cabernet. It opens with savory stewy earthy aromas of berry fruits and prune. Due to the 15.5% abv, this feels heavy and clampy, with rooty flavors of baked berry fruits, cola, minty herbs and carob. An oaky spicy toasty finish with heat is the closing act on this fully stuffed Salta blend.",90
Roger Voss,Sobredos 2012 Aneto Tinto Red (Douro),"A ripe and structured wine, this has bold black fruits and balanced tannins that still need to soften. It has good potential with rich fruits and a tight mineral texture. Drink from 2018.",90
Virginie Boone,St. Supéry 2013 Rutherford Estate Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"Robust black fruit forms around a dense, leathery core of concentration and richness before allowing room for softer, intertwined tannins to add structure and more depth. Chocolate marks the finish of this big, bold wine.",90
Michael Schachner,Viña Cobos 2015 Bramare Marchiori Vineyard Chardonnay (Perdriel),"Oaky, smoky aromas are New World all the way.

Anna Lee C. Iijima,Von Schleinitz 2015 Apollo Dry Riesling (Mosel),"Fragrant notes of tangerine and yuzu peel abound on this citrusy dry Riesling.

Paul Gregutt,Beacon Hill 2013 Chehalem Mountain Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"Just one barrel was produced from the own-rooted vines planted almost 50 years ago. It's earthy and scented with a menthol/eucalyptus note, that carries on through. Cranberry flavor reflects the rather low alcohol, but there is no hint of unripeness or any vegetative character.",90
Roger Voss,Bernard Magrez 2012 La Sérénité des Grands Chênes  (Médoc),The 45% Cabernet Sauvignon in this wine gives it structure and aging potential. It is a ripe wine that is also stylish with attractive acidity and plenty of black-currant fruitiness. The wine is developing well and it should be ready to drink from 2018.,90
Sean P. Sullivan,Brian Carter Cellars 2012 Tuttorosso Red (Yakima Valley),"This wine is a blend of Sangiovese (66%), Cabernet Sauvignon (20%) and Syrah. The aromas are brooding, with notes of earth, toast, red fruit and spice. The palate brings tart tangy cranberry flavors that linger on the finish.",90
Matt Kettmann,Buttonwood 2015 Grenache Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),"The nose of this wine combines this grape's best attributes: bright, crisp citrus redolent in grapefruit and Key lime, but with a tropical touch of guava and pineapple. The palate is broad and ripe but restrained enough, with plush mango and guava laid against a chalky backbone.",90
Roger Voss,Château Corbin 2014 Divin de Corbin  (Saint-Émilion),"This is the second wine from one of the group of chateaus with Corbin in their names. It is a tight wine, firm with tannins and with a concentrated texture and flavors of over-extraction. That said, the wine will probably develop over time into something serious with a dark, dense aftertaste.",90
Roger Voss,Château Haut-Logat 2014  Haut-Médoc,"This is a perfumed wine, with mint flavors as well as blackberry fruits. There is still a dominant structure of tannins and the wood aging that will allow the wine to age well. The fruits give the wine weight while the aftertaste has great swathes of acidity. Drink from 2019.",90
Roger Voss,Château La Branne 2014  Médoc,"Produced from 30-year-old vines, this 55% Cabernet Sauvignon wine is firm with tannins as well as black-currant fruit. It is balanced with the potential to become a fruity wine with a soft texture. The acidity will keep it crisp and on point. Drink from 2018.",90
Roger Voss,Château Mayne Vieil 2014  Fronsac,"With ripe Merlot dominating this fine, blackberry flavored wine, it is fruity and rich. The acidity gives a crisper edge to the wine while the tannins come from a dry core. It is a wine in progress, full of potential and likely to be ready to drink from 2018.",90
Roger Voss,Château Mille-Roses 2012  Margaux,"This 23-acre-estate is situated in the south of the Margaux appellation, close to classed growth Château Giscours. While not classified, it still has the ability to produce a fine ripe wine that also has great structure. Acidity and firm tannins are very present along with concentrated blackberry fruits. Drink this fine wine from 2019.",90
Matt Kettmann,Chessman 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Ynez Valley),"With black cherry, blueberry, milk chocolate and balsamic reduction offsetting the light dill herbaceousness, this wine offers surprising depth for the affordable price. The texture is soft, yet the tannins stand up to the black cherry, charcoal and black-pepper flavors.",90
Virginie Boone,Deerfield Ranch NV Tawny Estate Syrah (Sonoma Valley),"Made entirely from Syrah grown on its property across multiple vintages, and then cave-aged six years in American oak, this is a nice dessert wine, raisiny and brimming in Christmas spice. With plenty of body and acidity, it swims effortlessly and smoothly on the palate, a bite of decadence that will work well with rich cheeses.",90
Roger Voss,Domaine Franck Besson 2014 Le Griottier  (Juliénas),"This is a firm wine, balancing some solid tannins with ripe red fruits. Still young, it is packed with fruitiness and with acidity that are centered around a firm core. Drink this stylish wine from 2018.",90
Sean P. Sullivan,Efeste 2013 Upright Klipsun Vineyard Merlot (Red Mountain),"Aromas of savory herbs, mineral, exotic spice and red fruit are followed by fruit flavors that are surprisingly restrained considering the warmth of the vintage. Tart acidity livens it up. It's green for the variety but still brings enjoyment.",90
Sean P. Sullivan,Efeste 2014 Lola Evergreen Vineyard Chardonnay (Ancient Lakes),"The aromas of mineral, spice, toast, yellow apple and lemon pith are light but enchanting. The palate is medium bodied and refined, demonstrating judicious use of oak and a lengthy finish that shows some warmth.",90
Paul Gregutt,Firesteed 2012 Riesling (Oregon),"Bone dry and replete with skin flavors of pear and grapefruit pith, this is perfect for those who want to keep their alcohol consumption down without turning to a sweeter style of wine. Try it with grilled sausages and sauerkraut.",90
Jim Gordon,Iron Hub 2014 Small Lot Chardonnay (Sierra Foothills),"Very smooth, almost thick, this is a rich wine in flavor and mouthfeel. It practically oozes over the palate, dripping with ripe pineapple, vanilla and cream, and coats every corner of the mouth before lingering through a long finish. It's full bodied, soft and concentrated.",90
Joe Czerwinski,Kooyong 2013 Farrago Chardonnay (Mornington Peninsula),"Without any new oak or lees stirring, this wine's sole focus is on the fruit. Pineapple, melon and peach notes are pure and striking, supported by just hints of vanilla and cream. This medium-bodied Chardonnay finishes in a flurry of tangerine and lime.",90
Kerin O’Keefe,Moncaro 2015 Le Vele  (Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi Classico),"Aromas of ripe orchard fruit and chopped herb jump out of the glass. The savory palate serves up juicy Bartlett pear, green apple, citrus and a mint note while a hint of white almond adds depth. Very appealing.",90
Michael Schachner,Finca Constancia 2011 Parcela 23 Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),"Mild raisin, black cherry, anise and burnt tire aromas lead to a plump, balanced palate that's full but not overloaded. Earthy baked black-fruit flavors show a hint of oaky coconut, while this Tempranillo finishes with depth and density.",90
Virginie Boone,Aiken 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"This wine opens with a confectionary nose, slowly unleashing its thick, concentrated richness of dark cherry and cassis on the palate. Between the layers are grippy tannins and shakes of meaty leather and black pepper. This could stand some time in a decanter or swirling in the glass before enjoying.",90
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Castell 2015 Castell Silvaner (Franken),"White blossom perfume accents notes of fresh lemon, lime and green melon in this aromatic Silvaner. While dry in style, it's refreshingly juicy on the palate, bursting with pristine citrus flavor tinged by edges of lime and lemon pith. Mouth filling and rich in texture, it clings lusciously through a long finish.",90
Jim Gordon,Donkey & Goat 2013 Perli Vineyards Syrah (Mendocino Ridge),"This is a particularly expressive wine with lots of personality. It opens with aromas of cherry, tea and wood smoke, and tastes very dry and structured with vivid fruit acidity and tannins. Sour cherry and raspberry provide the fruit flavors.",90
Joe Czerwinski,Torbreck 2013 Cuvee Juveniles Red (Barossa Valley),"Built for early consumption, this blend of 59% Grenache, 22% Shiraz and 19% Mataro is lush and warm, offering chocolaty notes alongside hints of brown sugar, grilled meat and blueberries. Drink now–2022.",90
Kerin O’Keefe,Valdicava 2012  Rosso di Montalcino,"Aromas of toasted oak, crushed blue flower, underbrush, espresso, licorice and toasted notes take center stage. There's not much fruit richness here so drink now before it fades.",86
Sean P. Sullivan,Finn Hill 2013 Soleil Sauvignon Blanc (Wahluke Slope),"All from Rosebud Vineyard, this moderately aromatic wine brings notes of herbs and pineapple, with Sémillon (15%) adding fig to the mix. The concentration doesn't seem all there and it needs a bit more acid to stand it up.",86
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Keuka Spring 2013 Pre-Emption Vineyard Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes),"While demure on the nose, this light-footed Gewürztraminer is pretty on the palate with delicate lychee and floral notes. Its unusually nervous and shy for it's variety, but refreshingly quaffable.",86
Michael Schachner,La Playa 2012 Block Selection Reserve Block N. 10 Merlot (Colchagua Valley),"Earthy, lightly stewed aromas of plum and berry set up a lively but pinched and narrow palate with candied flavors of mixed red berry fruits. Additional red-fruit friendliness rolls onto the finish of this pleasant but basic Merlot.",86
Roger Voss,Les Vins Aujoux 2013 Belle Grâce  (Beaujolais-Villages),"The wine is warm and round, full of ripe berry fruits and soft tannins. It's ready to drink now with its full structure, balanced acidity and juicy aftertaste.",86
Roger Voss,Mont Gravet 2013 Colombard (Côtes de Gascogne),"Soft, ripe and fruity, this is an immediately accessible, drinkable wine. It's soft with lemon and yellow fruits coming together to give a fresh, lively apéritif style of wine.",86
Michael Schachner,Navardia 2013 Made With Organic Grapes  (Rioja),"Cherry and cassis aromas are a touch flat and jammy. This shows grabby tannins as well as loamy, earthy, lightly bitter flavors of black fruits. The finish lumbers along with size and tannic grip, but overall this blend of 65% Tempranillo, 25% Graciano and 10% Garnacha shows well.",86
Michael Schachner,Pata Negra NV Brut Sparkling (Cava),"Bready aromas feature melon as the main fruit scent. This is chunky in feel, with moderate acidity and cut. Apple, melon and green-herb flavors finish with hints of toast, yeast and generic sweetness.",86
Kerin O’Keefe,Ridolfi 2012  Rosso di Montalcino,"This displays evident oak sensations of sweet vanilla, toast, espresso, milk chocolate and mature black plum alongside drying tannins. There's not much fresh acidity so drink soon before it dries out.",86
Matt Kettmann,Still Waters 2010 Malbec (Paso Robles),"Grape soda, prune, leather, graphite, dust and black tobacco blend into an intriguing nose on this estate Malbec from Paso's Eastside. It's a little rustic around the edges once sipped, but pleasantly so. The mouthfeel is soft, the flavors are peppery and the tannins and acidity are built to last.",86
Jim Gordon,Stomping Ground 2010 Merlot (California),"Nothing is out of place in this solid, attractive and well-priced Merlot. It is a straightforward red wine that feels well-balanced, is medium to full-bodied, and has tasty, mellow plum and cherry flavors. Firm tannins mark the clean finish.",86
Kerin O’Keefe,Tenuta Poggio il Castellare 2009  Brunello di Montalcino,"Roasted coffee bean, underbrush, toast and allspice lead the nose on this big wine. The one-dimensional palate offers dense cherry extract, licorice and the warmth of alcohol. It's already evolved so drink now.",86
Kerin O’Keefe,Tenuta San Giorgio 2012 Ciampoleto  (Rosso di Montalcino),"This wine brings together sensations of tilled earth, espresso, oak extract, coffee, overripe black plum and vanilla. The palate displays tightly packed tannins but it's low on fresh acidity so drink it soon.",86
Michael Schachner,Terrapura 2012 Merlot (Curicó Valley),"Leathery, briny plum aromas are full and herbal. This feels solid and medium in size and body. Flavors of earthy, roasted berry and plum finish lightly green and herbal, with a touch of sweetness.",86
Roger Voss,Clos Troteligotte 2013 K-libre Chenin Blanc (Côtes du Lot),"Chenin Blanc has found an unlikely new home in Cahors, to judge by the producers who are trying it out. It works well, giving a deliciously nutty character as well as intense citrus and minerality. Age this wine until 2015.",86
Paul Gregutt,Columbia Winery 2013 Viognier (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A clean, fresh wine, this opens with crisply varietal aromatics of citrus and orange blossom. The flavors follow suit, adding some fresh-cut pineapple as well; then the wine hits a wall and simply pulls up short.",86
Roger Voss,Domaine de Thulon 2013  Beaujolais-Villages,"Crisp while also fruity, it has bright acidity, lively citrus and apple flavors and a refreshing aftertaste. Drink now.",86
Roger Voss,Domaine du Haut-Poncié 2013 Roche Grès  (Moulin-à-Vent),Some wood aging gives the fruitiness of the wine an added spice. Tannins support the bitter cherry flavors and add firmness to the juicy acidity. Drink from the end of 2015.,86
Roger Voss,Domaine du Vissoux 2013 Coeur de Vendanges  (Beaujolais),"The wine is very fresh, with intense acidity and fragrant red fruits. Made from 100-year-old vines, it's tight, mineral and has a cool, light character with the merest hint of tannin. Drink now.",86
Kerin O’Keefe,Dosio 2012  Nebbiolo d'Alba,"Aromas of a closed cellar blow off in the glass to reveal underbrush, violet, woodland berries and a hint of white pepper that all carry over to the palate. It's one-dimensional with fresh acidity and would work well with deep-dish pizza covered with toppings.",86
Michael Schachner,G7 2012 Reserva Estate Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Loncomilla Valley),"Briary, spicy, mildly herbal berry aromas give way to a full, bold, wiry feeling palate with pointed acidity. Herbal, lightly green flavors of tobacco and plum finish crisp.",86

Michael Schachner,Juvé y Camps NV Cinta Púrpura Brut Reserva Sparkling (Cava),"Apple and melon aromas are standard and light. A juicy, citrusy feeling palate delivers stone-fruit flavors of peach and nectarine. A mild finish is fresh in flavor and feel.",86
Michael Schachner,Juvé y Camps NV Sweet Reserva Sparkling (Cava),"Generic white-fruit and matchstick aromas are quiet in nature. This is creamy and not assaulting or sugary on the palate. Mango, melon, lychee and citrus flavors finish with lime notes.",86
Paul Gregutt,Kontos 2011 Les Collines Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Despite the abv listed, this wine does not seem especially ripe. Peppery highlights carry a whiff of onion, and between the alcohol burn and the green edges, the wine has not come together. Aging in 40% new oak adds some toast, but not grip or density.",86
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Lamoreaux Landing 2013 Yellow Dog Vineyard Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Blossoms and yellow cherries lend a sweet floral flair on the nose of this dry Riesling. It's straightforward in style, but quaffable and refreshing, with flavors of fresh apple and pear that finish crisp and clean.",86
Roger Voss,Laurent Gauthier 2013 Rosé (Beaujolais Rosé),"This is a rich style of rosé, rounded and fruity with good texture, wild strawberry flavors and very crisp acidity at the end. It's an attractive wine and one that's worth keeping until 2015.",86

Roger Voss,Manoir du Carra 2013  Beaujolais-Villages,"While the wine has a crisp side, it's also full of red fruits and soft tannins. That makes for a wine that's fragrant, fruity, ready to drink and not likely to age much. Enjoy it now.",86
Paul Gregutt,Maryhill 2011 Proprietor's Reserve Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Aged for 20 months in 40% new French oak, this remains a tough nut to crack. It's encased in a hard tannic shell, with little ripe fruit, and is strongly flavored with barrel notes of tobacco and vanilla. Decant it or put it through an aerator.",86
Kerin O’Keefe,Cottanera 2015 Bianco  (Etna),"Aromas of citrus, white stone fruit and a vegetal hint suggesting tomato leaf lead the way. The racy palate offers grapefruit, pineapple, fresh white peach and flinty mineral while a pleasantly bitter note closes the finish.",90

Anne Krebiehl MW,Domaine Barmès-Buecher 2014 Rosenberg Sylvaner (Alsace),"A soft, stony scent of pebble and the faintest melon signals a fresh, clean wine.

Anne Krebiehl MW,Domaine Bott-Geyl 2012 Galets Oligocène Pinot Noir (Alsace),"The Pinot-ness of this wine is undeniable: its structure is of velvet, and its aromas convey freshly turned earth, autumnal oak leaf and subdued red-cherry fruit. There is a depth that evokes deep forests. Have this with furred or feathered game.",90
Roger Voss,Domaine Collotte 2014 Clos de Jeu  (Marsannay),"With tannins and new-wood flavors, this rich wine is also structured. A smoky character from the wood is shot through by perfumed red fruits. The aftertaste shows more of the wood flavors that need to integrate. Drink from 2018.",90
Roger Voss,Domaine Faiveley 2014  Gevrey-Chambertin,"This is a blend from most parts of the village, with fruit from 14 different parcels. It is solid and firm while also having great swathes of raspberries and red plums laced together with acidity. The aftertaste is perfumed with a fresh lift. Drink from 2018",90
Roger Voss,Domaine Jacques Prieur 2014 Grèves Premier Cru  (Beaune),"Young vines, planted in 2007, give a fresh, fruity wine with attractive citrus and zingy orange flavors. It is ripe and deliciously perfumed with a touch of minerality and saltiness. Drink from 2019.",90
Roger Voss,Domaine René Bouvier 2014 Champ Salomon  (Marsannay),"With intense acidity, this wine has both good structure and red currant and raspberry fruits. It is bright, fresh and almost crisp in character. In the background, the tannins show the dense texture of the wine. It will need to age, so don't drink before 2019.",90
Anne Krebiehl MW,Domaine Roland Schmitt 2014 Grand A du Petit Léon Sylvaner (Alsace),"Bruised apple and dandelion notes play spicily on the textured, slightly phenolic palate. The central streak of freshness brightens all aspects of the wine, which might gain complexity with a year or two more in bottle. For now it remains intriguingly poised between earthy richness and ethereal lift.",90
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Dr. H. Thanisch (Erben Thanisch) 2014 Thanisch Kabinett Riesling (Mosel),"A dusting of crushed slate and saffron accents this zesty lime and honey kissed Kabinett. It's dancingly light on the palate, but concentrated with swirls of marmalade and orange-peel flavors that extend through a long finish. Drink now through 2025.",90
Jim Gordon,Easton 2014 Zinfandel (Amador County),"An interesting vein of tasty herb flavor runs through this full-bodied, plump and fruity wine. The aroma has hints of dill and sage, and these mingle with black cherry and blueberry on the palate. A sleek texture and long finish complete the picture.",90
Matt Kettmann,Edna Valley Vineyard 2013 Reserve Chardonnay (Edna Valley),"Quite buttery and nutty on the nose, this wine shows Marcona almonds, seared pineapple, crème brûlée and vanilla custard. Those elements meet with smart amounts of acid and texture on each creamy, buttery, pineapple-laced sip, which then finishes on marshmallow flavors.",90
Kerin O’Keefe,Fattoria La Rivolta 2015 Taburno Fiano (Sannio),"Scents of pressed white flower, orchard fruit, smoke, citrus and a whiff of nut lead the nose on this savory white. The round, medium-bodied palate offers mature pear, pineapple, peach and hazelnut while a note of flinty mineral lifts the finish.",90
Matt Kettmann,Fess Parker 2013 Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"Tar and beef char kick off the nose on this dark and heavy wine, which offers asphalt, smoked meats and crushed elderberry. Caramelized beef, balsamic-blackberry reduction, tobacco and touches of smoke show on the palate.",90

Virginie Boone,Foretell 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District),"This is a generous, leathery and tannic wine, full-bodied and made in a juicy, foreboding style. Black pepper, leather and cigar smoke provide a sultry, robust edge to the wine, which should cellar well, through 2020.",90
Matt Kettmann,Gershon Bachus 2009 Erato De Portola Trail Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Temecula Valley),"Fresh cracked peppercorn, dense black and purple fruit and a cedar tone carry through the nose of this lavish yet nuanced bottling from a South Coast winery that practices extended aging before release.

Kerin O’Keefe,Tornatore 2015 Rosato (Etna),"Alluring scents of Spanish broom, iris, berry and a hint of dried herb come together on this. The bright palate offers candied cherry, nectarine zest, white pepper and a hint of fennel while a mineral note signals the finish.",90
Matt Kettmann,West of Temperance 2012 Rio Vista Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Lighter bramble and red-currant fruits pop on the nose of this wine from the appellation's eastern end, as do baking-spice notes, crushed vanilla and hibiscus. It's airy on the palate, with tense cranberry and pomegranate, crushed oregano and dill, pencil lead minerality and a slowly simmering acidity.",90
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Winzergenossenschaft Mayschoss-Altenahr 2013 Trocken Früburgunder (Ahr),"Quite rare in the U.S. market, this ripe richly berried wine is an excellent example of Frühburgunder, an early ripening mutation of Pinot Noir.

Kerin O’Keefe,Baglio del Cristo di Campobello 2015 Laluci White (Sicilia),"This offers heady aromas of honeysuckle, white stone fruit, dill, hay and a vegetal note that recalls tomato leaf.

Joe Czerwinski,Beresford 2014 Handpicked Grenache Rosé (McLaren Vale),"This is ripe, rich and even a touch tannic—almost more of a light red than a true rosé. This makes it ideally suited to serve alongside summer's various grilled meats. Raspberry and cola flavors finish spicy and round.",90
Paul Gregutt,Carabella 2013 Estate Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"Fresh fruit flavors suggest a bowl full of berries and cherries. Crisp acids help to focus the wine, with spot-on varietal flavors and balance. Both elegant and complex, it's a lovely bottle from an under-the-radar producer.",90
Michael Schachner,Carmen 2014 Gran Reserva Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),"Composed berry, spice, herb and oak aromas are complete and inviting.

Matt Kettmann,Casa Dumetz 2014 Larner Grenache (Ballard Canyon),"The most reserved of this winery's Grenache studies, this bottling shows baked red cherry, red currant, cola and slate on the nose. An iron-based minerality shows on the earthy palate, which also offers chipped slate, cranberry and tart cherry elements. It's a tad light but still intriguingly textured.",90
Jim Gordon,Greenwood Ridge 2013 Estate Bottled Syrah (Mendocino Ridge),"This is an amazingly tasty and focused wine that has the most distinctive black pepper character. It's medium-bodied, dark and smoky looking and quite flavorful, backing up the pepper with lively raspberry notes and staying lively from the first sip to the last.",90
Virginie Boone,Herencia 2013 Merlot (Napa Valley),Chocolate and blackberry form an impressively generous and full-bodied personality in this 100% varietal wine aged 22 months in a hearty percentage of new oak. Big tannin and traces of cigar and espresso continue on the brawny theme.,90
Paul Gregutt,J. Scott Cellars 2015 Albariño (Oregon),"Not such a rarity these days, Albariño is turning heads in California and Oregon.

Roger Voss,Roquette e Cazes 2007 Red (Douro),"The latest release from the partnership between the Roquette family of Quinta do Crasto in the Douro and the Cazes family of Château Lynch-Bages in Bordeaux.

Michael Schachner,Vall Llach 2007 Idus Red (Priorat),"Ripe and sweet, with lush, raisiny aromas. The palate is flush, deep and layered, with baked berry, prune, toast and coffee flavors. This is a lot like Vall Llach's signature '07, but it's a bit more restrained and at $50 it's a better deal than the $95 wine. Still, it's a heavyweight to drink now through 2013.",90
,Ceralti 2008 Alfeo  (Bolgheri Superiore),"Here's an elegant and clean blend of Merlot (50%), Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc from coastal Tuscany that offers intensity and well-measured aromas of ripe cherry, espresso bean and tobacco.

Michael Schachner,Fuentes 2008 Coraje Red (Priorat),"Ripe black fruit aromas aren't overly complex or nuanced but they are generous.

The somewhat subdued bouquet leads to a generous mouthfeel that leaves a long-lasting impression.",90
,J Vineyards & Winery NV Brut Rose Sparkling (Russian River Valley),"Pretty dark in color and full bodied for a sparkling wine, even one that's majority Pinot Noir.

,Kokomo 2008 Petite Sirah (Dry Creek Valley),"So soft, silky and sweet in blackberries, cherries and red currants, it could be a big, ripe Pinot Noir. That's a compliment.

Lauren Buzzeo,Loup Blanc 2007 La Mère Grand Red (Minervois),"This Grenache-heavy blend (with 20% Syrah) offers a good amount of bittersweet cocoa powder and rich jammy black berries and all-fruit preserves on the nose and mouth. A hint of gaminess adds interest to the bouquet, while the crushed velvet texture and firm tannins transition into a long finish laced with earthy spice.",90
Roger Voss,Maritávora 2009 Reserva Branco White (Douro),"Aromas of fresh-cut hay lead to a wine that has considerable concentration and good balance from wood aging. Very citrus with pineapple touches, it finishes with an herbaceous feel. The wine comes from a vineyard planted at the end of the 19th century.",90
Paul Gregutt,Owen Roe 2009 Slide Mountain Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Yakima Valley),"A complex mix of wild berry, cherry and somewhat brambly fruits provides a substantial core to this wine. The fruit rolls on through a slightly chalky patch, then finishes with a flourish of toast and graphite.",90

Medium-grained tannins give the finish some gravitas.",90
Joe Czerwinski,Hungerford Hill 2008 Heavy Metal Shiraz (South Eastern Australia),"This is an unusually complex Shiraz for the price, ably marrying meaty-savory notes with tart berries and plenty of weight on the palate. Crisp structure, finishes long, with lingering acids. Drink now–2018.",90
,Jacopo Biondi-Santi 2008 Castello di Montepò  (Morellino di Scansano),"Jacopo Biondi Santi hits a home run with this beautiful Morellino. The wine is smooth and dense, with lively cherry notes, soft spice and tobacco. It's straightforward and plush, but elegant at the same time.",90
,Le Buche 2006 Giuseppe Olivi Memento Red (Toscana),"Le Buche is an interesting winery to watch, and its various Tuscan blends show great promise. Memento is equal parts Sangiovese and Syrah with a soft, velvety texture and a bright berry finish.",90
Virginie Boone,Leonesse Cellars 2007 Signature Selection Syrah (Temecula Valley),"Aged a little more than two years in 90% new French oak and then in bottle, time has been kind to this wine, a Syrah of dark mushroom and baked blackberry, that's savory and silky with a slight hint of mint on the finish. Mighty and impressive.",90
Paul Gregutt,Market Vineyards 2008 Dividend Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Dusty and tight, with a whiff of coffee and cocoa introducing an elegant wine with interesting streaks of metal and graphite. Young fruit and fine tannins are in perfect balance, and the wine has a lovely delicacy.",90
,Marsiliana 2005 Red (Toscana),"This vintage of Marsiliana (the top wine from the Maremma property of Prince Corsini) shows rich tones of espresso, chocolate, dark fruit, leather and spice. The wine is soft and well extracted, with a slightly tough, chewy finish.",90
,Mazzei 2009 Fonterutoli  (Chianti Classico),"Tuscany's Mazzei family delivers a wonderful Chianti Classico from their Fonterutoli estate that would pair perfectly with grilled meats or oven-roasted pasta. This is a soft, lush wine with bright cherry and spice notes, which drive a long, velvety finish.",90
Michael Schachner,Morlanda 2007 Criança Red (Priorat),"It has taken a few years but Morlanda has reached a nice place with this wine. Look for ripeness and concentrated black fruit aromas, and then a ripe palate with herbal blackberry and chocolate. Smooth on the finish, with a tiny bit of burn. Drink now through 2014.",90
Roger Voss,Quinta do Vallado 2010 Reserva Branco White (Douro),"A wood-aged white, spicy and ripe. It has just the right balance of acidity to go with the ripe green plum and melon fruits. With a great bite of acidity to finish, this is a wine that will age for 3–4 years.",90
Alexander Peartree,Becker 2014 Reserve Bingham Vineyard Roussanne (Texas High Plains),"White lily, popcorn kernel, citrus spray and underripe peach lead the well-integrated and restrained nose. The palate follows suit, remaining quiet and delicate in flavor concentration, yet loud in weight and texture. Salty citrus lingers on the finish.",87
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Bex 2014 Riesling (Nahe),"Whiffs of smoke and nuts mingle into tart tangerine and lime flavors in this refreshing off-dry Riesling. Juicy and fresh, it's a straightforward, revitalizing sip. Drink now through 2018.",87
Kerin O’Keefe,Boffa 2013 Pajè  (Barbaresco),"Aromas of leather, vineyard dust, dried violet and a whiff of pressed powder lead the nose. The simple palate isn't very expressive, showing sour red cherry and a hint of baking spice alongside close-grained tannins that dry out the finish.",87
Alexander Peartree,Brennan 2014 Super Nero Nero d'Avola (Texas),"An enticing mix of dark berries and fatty, cured sausage makes for an interesting nose. There's good structure and balance on the palate with this southern Italian transplant. It's juicy, ripe and ready for barbecue.",87
Alexander Peartree,Brennan 2015 Reddy Vineyard Roussanne (Texas High Plains),"Peach, canned tropical fruit and white flower aromas are pristine on the nose. The medium-bodied palate shows a balance of juicy peach and pineapple, with streaks of chalk and a vein of acidity. This is clean, succinct and perfectly enjoyable on its own.",87
Roger Voss,Casa de Vilacetinho 2013 Bruto Avesso (Vinho Verde),"A fresh lemon-flavored wine with crisp acidity balanced by warmer white-stone fruit. It is fruity, showing a touch of toast and almonds. Drink now.",87
Kerin O’Keefe,Cascina Bruciata 2013  Barbaresco,"The nose isn't very expressive, offering aromas of toasted hazelnut, while the dense, simple palate shows dried black cherry and licorice. It's shy on freshness and has round but rather fleeting tannins. Drink through 2018.",87
Kerin O’Keefe,Castello di Neive 2013  Barbaresco,"This opens with aromas of toast, oak, menthol, resin, coffee bean and medicinal notes. The aromas carry over to the firm palate, along with thyme, clove, licorice and bracing tannins.",87
Michael Schachner,Antucura 2011 Grand Vin Red (Vista Flores),"Flat in color, with a dull luster, this smells mulchy and earthy, with dampness to the nose. A thick, medicinal palate is dealing severe tannins embedded into a syrupy texture. Flavors of fig, raisin and earth are a little spent.",87
Lauren Buzzeo,Frédéric Brouca 2013 Samsó Seulle Cinsault (Vin de France),"Juicy dark plum, cherry and boysenberry are upfront on the nose, with additional seductive hints of purple violet and vanilla. The palate is plush and fruit-forward, with ample acidity and medium tannins that lend pleasant structure. Accents of sweet spice grace the finish.",87
Paul Gregutt,Fullerton 2015 Three Otters Pinot Noir Rosé (Willamette Valley),"This light, refreshing rosé mixes fresh strawberry fruit with apple-flavored acids. It's finished bone dry, with an almost dusty mouthfeel (in a good kind of way).",87
Mike DeSimone,Gotsa Family Wines 2014 Asureti Valley Chinuri,"Amber in color, this wine has aromas of peach jam and orange blossom. Flavors are a mélange of mellow fruit and savory notes, in particular apricot, lemon curd, quince and bitter almond. Despite strong tannins, there are moments of brightness across the entire palate that linger into the finish.",87
Michael Schachner,Graffigna 2012 Grand Reserve Malbec (San Juan),"Smashed berry aromas are backed by earth and toasty oak notes. Fairly hard and tannic on the palate, this shows herbal plum flavors in front of a bold finish with dry tannins and a hint of wood spice.",87
Paul Gregutt,Coelho 2014 Atração Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This is smooth and accessible, putting a light chocolate frame around rhubarb and strawberry fruit. There's a hint of pepper, and the wine is fresh and youthful, good sipping wine for late summer/early fall.",87
Paul Gregutt,Coelho 2015 Renovação Estate Vineyards Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"Quite tart, the fruit here touches (just barely) on melon, with orange and lemon zest, a bit of lime, and plenty of acid. All stainless fermented, it went through full malolactic.",87
Kerin O’Keefe,Deltetto 2012 Bussia  (Barolo),"This has aromas suggesting grilled herb, toasted oak, espresso and a whiff of wet animal fur. The palate offers dried cherry, game, anisette and a green note of bitter sage alongside extremely astringent tannins.",87
Kerin O’Keefe,Diego Conterno 2012 Ginestra  (Barolo),"This opens with aromas of toasted oak, roasted coffee bean and a whiff of sawdust. The bracing palate offers dried cherry, espresso and mocha alongside astringent tannins. Give the tannins another year or two to unwind then drink to capture the remaining fruit.",87
Michael Schachner,Domaine Bousquet 2015 Reserve Pinot Gris (Tupungato),"Despite looking gold and mature, this PG exceeds expectations courtesy of waxy, baked-apple aromas and a full but balanced mouthfeel. Spiced apple, apricot and burnt orange flavors finish long due to core acidity. Drink immediately.",87
Joe Czerwinski,Evans & Tate 2015 Breathing Space Sauvignon Blanc (Australia),"Green beans and snap peas give this Sauvignon Blanc a green cast overall, but there's some citrus and gooseberry fruit as well. It's clean and refreshing on the finish.",87
Roger Voss,Falua 2015 Conde Vimioso Colheita Seleccionada Branco White (Tejo),"A blend of Fernão Pires and Arinto, this is totally crisp and refreshingly fruity. It is perfumed, smooth while also cut with acidity. The acidity comes from both citrus and pineapple flavors. Drink now.",87
Michael Schachner,Finca Sophenia 2015 Altosur Sauvignon Blanc (Tupungato),"Aromas of citrus and petrol are backed by a juicy palate with tangy acidity and semisharp flavors of peach, tangerine and stone-fruit pits. Fresh, citrusy length and a lingering note of orange are the finish.",87
Roger Voss,Fiuza 2015 Red (Tejo),"Known in Spain as Graciano, this grape produces attractive, fruity wine especially in the Tejo region. This example is ripe with layers of acidity as well as a generous texture. Soft and smooth, it is ready to drink.",87
Joe Czerwinski,Sidewood 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Adelaide Hills),"This medium-bodied wine features aromas of green apple and crushed stone, while the flavors turn citrusy, veering toward lime and grapefruit. It's nicely silky in texture, while a hint of snow pea marks the finish.",87
Jim Gordon,Terre Rouge 2013 Vin Doux Naturel Muscat Blanc à Petits Grains (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),"An earthy, nutty aroma and flavor come through the intense sweetness and full body of this dessert-style wine. It goes for earthy complexity rather than obvious fruit flavors, and tastes high in sugar and alcohol.",87
Michael Schachner,Antonio Mas 2011 Roll Fermentor Malbec (Tupungato),"This Malbec is a collection of disparate parts that doesn't justify its price. Reduced plum and grapy berry aromas come with woodsy notes of menthol and cola. Highly herbal, saucy, savory flavors are more oaky than fruity, while this finishes with muscular tannins and savory, grapy notes.",87
Roger Voss,Aveleda NV Casal Garcia Rosé Sparkling (Vinho Verde),"This is crisp and fresh medium-sweet wine. It is bright with red-currant acidity and ripe with a strawberry and cream flavor. The wine is clean, lively and, of course, ready to drink.",87
Kerin O’Keefe,Battaglio 2013  Barbaresco,"Cellar floor, eucalyptus, black spice and a note recalling grilled celery lead the nose. The ripe palate offers mature black cherry, star anise and a hint of orange zest while assertive, tightly knit tannins leave an astringent finish.",87
Jim Gordon,Bella Grace 2013 Estate Zinfandel (Amador County),"This full-bodied wine is in the classic mode, offering very ripe and even overripe aromas. Voluptuous berry flavors verge on sweet, and the rich texture comes without a lot of drying tannin.",87
Michael Schachner,Bodega Calle 2014 Alberti 154 Malbec (Mendoza),"Roasted, woodsy, rubbery aromas are gamy and staunch, with berry notes interspersed. Grabby, rubbery tannins make for a rugged palate, while roasted plum and gamy flavors are a touch salty. A tannic finish doesn't change much.",87
Kerin O’Keefe,Borgogno F.lli Serio e Battista 2012  Barolo,"Berry, menthol and a hint of espresso aromas lead the way while the straightforward palate shows mature black-skinned berry, coffee and a hint of licorice. It's already approachable. Drink through 2020.",87
Roger Voss,Château les Petits Arnauds 2014 Tradition  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux),"The wood flavors are still prominent in this spicy wine. Heavily influenced by rich Merlot, the wine is lightly structured and more about juicy red fruits. Tannins in the back give enough shape, although it will be ready to drink from early 2017.",87
Roger Voss,Château Mougneaux 2014  Bordeaux Supérieur,"While the wine is firm and tannic at this early stage, it does have the potential to bring out a more fruity character. The red-berry fruits and acidity are there, promising a fresh wine from 2018.",87
Roger Voss,Château Saintongey 2014 Vieilles Vignes  (Bordeaux),"Ripe fruit and balanced acidity allow this wine to make room for touches of wood aging. It has spice, a smoky character and attractive finishing freshness. Drink from 2017 when the wine will be fully balanced.",87
Roger Voss,Château Ségonzac 2014 Vieilles Vignes  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux),"From a estate in the Marmet family since 1990, the wine has ripe Merlot flavors that give a generous character. Big, bold fruitiness dominates this wine whose structure is firm while smooth. Drink starting from 2019.",87
Paul Gregutt,Chehalem 2013 Ian's Reserve Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"This is surprisingly light, having dropped significantly in alcohol from the previous vintage. Green-fruit flavors touch on banana and apple, and the wood—31% new and 26% once-used—seems to show a bit of rawness. Give this another couple of years of bottle age before opening.",87
Paul Gregutt,Chehalem 2015 Stoller Vineyards Pinot Blanc (Dundee Hills),"This is a pleasant white wine, albeit rather generic, as Pinot Blanc is prone to be. Crisp apple flavors and a touch of grapefruit are the focus. Drink chilled and enjoy it while it's still young and fresh.",87
Michael Schachner,Covila 2013 II Crianza  (Rioja),"Earthy, cool aromas of wet cement, raisin and raspberry are a bit flat. This feels drawing and tannic, with flavors of tomato, red plum, currant and raspberry. A full-size finish is comfortable but not very complex.",87
Jim Gordon,Cuda Ridge Wines 2013 Melange d'Amis Reserve Red (Livermore Valley),"This wine puts jammy aromas, very ripe flavors, full body and deep, dark fruit flavors on a broad, soft texture.",87
Roger Voss,Duménil NV Grande Réserve Premier Cru Brut  (Champagne),"Neatly divided between the three major grapes of Champagne, this full, ripe wine is packed with rich apple and pear fruits. It is crisp while showing a high dosage giving a softer, smoother aftertaste. Drink this bottling now.",87
Michael Schachner,Ego Bodegas 2014 Goru Verde Monastrell (Jumilla),"Cool aromas of cola, leather and black cherry set up a fairly full but fresh palate with moderate creamy weight. This tastes reedy and spicy, with wild-berry fruit, peppery notes and a distinct flavor of creamy oak. On the finish, this is oaky and herbal tasting.",87
Virginie Boone,Ektimo Vineyards 2014 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Stewy plum and cherry jam lie at the heart of this densely layered, though silky-smooth wine, light bodied and ethereal despite the ripeness of fruit flavor. It finishes simply and without fuss.",87
Michael Schachner,Finca del Marquesado 2013 Crianza  (Rioja),"Slightly gritty aromas are just barely ripe enough. This feels tight, acidic and like tomato juice. Flavors of salty berry fruits, tomato, oak and vanilla are modest but complete. Given how cool 2013 was in Rioja, this is quite good.",87
Paul Gregutt,Folin Cellars 2015 Estate Viognier (Rogue Valley),"Sharply defined, this has piercing, penetrating high notes that are both floral and fruity. Its lemon and tangerine fruit is amped up with some alcoholic burn. Aerating it helps to smooth it out.",87
Virginie Boone,Francis Coppola 2014 Director's Chardonnay (Sonoma County),"Director's sources from vineyards across the county to offer an intensity of fruit flavor that tends lush and ripe. Melon and vanilla appear on the nose and palate, with a side tone of pineapple, nutmeg and even clove, finishing clean and with simplicity.",87
Virginie Boone,Frank Family 2013 Reserve Winston Hill Vineyard Sangiovese (Rutherford),"Small amounts of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Petite Sirah are blended within this wine, given 17 months in new French oak plus once and twice-used barrels. The oak is integrated within this otherwise leathery, tannic and mild-mannered wine, ripe in cherry and cassis.",87
Roger Voss,Real Companhia Velha 2014 Evel Tinto Red (Douro),"Just lightly touched by wood this is a bright and fruity wine that is ready to drink. Spice and red-berry fruits dominate, lifted by balanced tannins. Drink now.",87
Roger Voss,Santos & Seixo 2014 Santos da Casa Tinto Red (Alentejano),"It is the 30% Alicante Bouschet in the blend that gives the dense color to this ripe wine. Concentrate and rich, the generous berry flavors are balanced by a more restrained acidity and smoky flavors. The wine is ready to drink.",87
Kerin O’Keefe,Travaglini 2014 Nebbiolo (Coste della Sesia),"Fragrant and fresh, this easy-drinking red has alluring scents of woodland berry, violet and a whiff of freshly tilled soil. The taut, luminous palate offers sour cherry and star anise accompanied by polished tannins and racy acidity.",87
Virginie Boone,Vine Cliff 2014 Chardonnay (Los Carneros),"With a richness to the nose, this wine possesses a medium-sized body and moderate acidity, showcasing ripe apple, pear and tropical elements. The finish is focused in simple notions of preserved lemon and pineapple.",87
Jim Gordon,Yorkville Cellars 2013 Rennie Vineyard Organic Grapes Petit Verdot (Yorkville Highlands),"This is a highly structured wine with an abundance of fine-grained tannins and firm acidity to support pure raspberry and blackberry flavors. It tastes as if it was made for aging, so wait and drink after 2019.",87
Michael Schachner,Agustí Torelló Mata 2015 XIC Xarel-lo (Penedès),"Dusty stone-fruit aromas suggest yeast and nectarine. This varietal Xarel-lo feels citrusy and spunky; flavors of melon, orange and nectarine are good but standard on the finish. Overall, this is linear and fairly basic for white wine.",87
Paul Gregutt,Amalie Robert 2012 i Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This new “i” series offering mixes brambly strawberry fruit with granular tannins. It's ready to drink, dappled with cinnamon, and leaves a slightly medicinal aftertaste in the back of the mouth.",87
Jim Gordon,Archgate Cellars 2014 Reserve Bottling Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi),"Full-bodied and smooth in texture, this generous-tasting wine has lots of ripe plum flavors and sweet-seeming oak accents.",87
Kerin O’Keefe,Bersano 2012 Nirvasco  (Barolo),"This offers scents and flavors that recall stewed prune, raisin and black pepper. It's still tight, with aggressive tannins that leave a firm clenching finish. Give it a few years to let the tannins unfurl then drink up to capture the remaining fruit.",87
Kerin O’Keefe,Cantine di Marzo NV Anni Venti Metodo Classico  (Greco di Tufo),"Here's a fun, informal sparkler that has aromas of citrus, orchard fruit and toast. The racy palate shows golden apple, pear, bitter almond and a lemon drop note.",87
Virginie Boone,Carica 2015 Ritchie Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),"The great Ritchie Vineyard, a renowned site for Chardonnay, also possesses highly sought-after Sauvignon Blanc. Here, it shows as grassy in pea shoots and thick, with a voluptuous texture and body weight.",87
Michael Schachner,Ignacio Marín 2015 Wine Wings Garnacha Rosé (Cariñena),"Crisp plum and red-bell-pepper aromas lead to a healthy, mostly fresh palate with some weight to it. A mix of citrus and red-plum flavors ends long, without much, if any, unwanted pithiness or bitterness.",87
Roger Voss,Jacquart NV Brut Mosaïque  (Champagne),"Partially from Grand Cru vineyards in the Montagne de Reims and the Côte des Blancs, this wine is soft, ripe and balanced, with a ripe dosage that contrasts with citrus acidity. It has a fine, cool texture.",87
Roger Voss,Château Cap Saint-Martin 2014  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux,"This is a fragrant, spicy wine that is shot through with red fruits and fine acidity. The 95% Merlot and 5% Cabernet Sauvignon blend is still firm with its tannins although the acidity and bright fruit are well in balance. Drink from 2018.",87
Roger Voss,Château de Bel 2014  Bordeaux Supérieur,This is a ripe wine and full of fruit. It has structure as well with its firm tannins and smoky backdrop. It will broaden out well and give a rich wine from 2018.,87
Roger Voss,Vranken NV Demoiselle Tête de Cuvée Brut  (Champagne),"A balanced wine, with softness that indicates a relatively high dosage. There is no complexity, but the wine is light, creamy, flavored with green plums and kiwi, just edged with bitterness.",85
Roger Voss,Château Pavillon de Boyrein 2006  Graves,"From a large 177-acre estate in the southern Graves, this wine shows plenty of stalky, black currant fruits, fresh acidity and spice from wood. It has just the right characters for a food Bordeaux, dry core of tannins and vivid fruit around.",85
,Fabiano 2006 Argillaia  (Lugana),"Here's a Trebbiano-based wine from the Lake Garda area in northern Italy that delivers smooth consistency and expressive notes of stone fruit, citrus, honey and crushed stone. The wine would pair well with lake fish or vegetable dishes.",85
,Vinosia 2006 Vecchie Vigne  (Primitivo di Manduria),"Packaged in a heavy, oversized black bottle, this brawny wine delivers power, bulging muscle and aromas that exaggerate in every way possible. The most noticeable feature (so noticeable, it knocks you in the face) is the wood element that comes off as fresh carpentry or wood shavings. The wine is heavy, syrupy and sweet tasting.",85
Joe Czerwinski,Kono 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"The 2004 and 2005 vintages of this wine were priced at $15, which gives some idea how fast the supply of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc has increased. Kono's 2008 is on the light side, but tart and zippy, with a refreshing aspect to its pineapple and grapefruit flavors and herbal overtones. Drink now.",85
Michael Schachner,Santa Ema 2008 Selected Terroir Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley),"Light and tropical, with buttercup aromas and a touch of citrus. The palate is plump and slightly oily, but with good acidity. Apple, mango and banana flavors are fruity and sweet, but overall the wine holds it together. Drink right away.",85
,Tommasi 2006 Chiaretto  (Bardolino Classico),"Corvina, Rondinella and Dindarella—three grapes native to the Verona area of Northern Italy—make up this fresh and lively, easy-sipping rosé. The wine awards pretty aromas of raspberry and white cherry.",85
Michael Schachner,Morandé 2008 Pionero Carmenère (Maipo Valley),"Good introductory Carmenère. It's a touch green, which is common for this quality level, but there's also some coconut and mild burnt aromas to wade through. Lively and clanky on the palate, with red fruit, bramble and herbal snap. Good if you're not expecting too much.",85
,One Hope 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"A little tough and gritty, but okay for everyday fare. Shows blackberry, currant, tobacco and herb flavors that turn sweetly fruity on the finish.",85
Roger Voss,Pommery NV Pop Rosé Extra Dry  (Champagne),"Although it is labeled “Extra Dry” (that is sweeter than Brut), this lively Champagne in its festive little pink bottle is very fresh, with delicious acidity. It finishes lightly, easily.",85
,Saddleback 2008 Viognier (Clarksburg),"Sweet in jammy apricots and pineapples, with even richer notes of smoky vanilla and buttered toast. Crisp acidity fortunately provides some balance. From Venge Vineyards.",85
,Alexander Valley Vineyards 2006 Alexander School Reserve Big Barrel Syrah (Alexander Valley),"A bit earthy and herbal, and soft, with cherry and cocoa fruit flavors. The acidity and tannin structure could be firmer.",85
Paul Gregutt,Covington 2006 Rough House Red Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"It's soft, slightly oxidized, and generic. It's pleasantly quaffable, marked in the finish by some rather bitter toast.",85
,Feudo Montoni 2008 P Pinot Noir (Sicilia),"Fabio Sireci is behind some of Sicily's best Nero d'Avola and has more recently decided to flex his winemaker muscle on Pinot Noir. The results are a tad jammy and muddled (his vineyards are smack in the middle of the Mediterranean island), ending with ripe aromas of prune and raisin.",85
,Kendall-Jackson 2008 Summation Vintner's Reserve White (California),"Clean and crisp, with rich flavors of citrus, pear, green apple, vanilla and honey. Finishes with that well-known K-J sweetness. A blend based on Sauvignon Blanc.",85
,Ledgewood Creek 2007 Estate Grown Viognier (Suisun Valley),"Sweet and simple, with pleasantly exotic flavors of pineapples, green apples, pears, honeysuckle flowers, minerals, spices, vanilla, brown sugar and smoky oak. Easy to drink.",85
,X 2008 White X White (North Coast),"A little on the sweet side, but crisp in acidity, and front-loaded with pineapple, grapefruit, tangerine, honeysuckle and spicy vanilla flavors. Sauvignon Blanc, Muscat Blanc, Chardonnay and Roussanne.",85
Roger Voss,Château Lamothe-Vincent 2008 Sauvignon  (Bordeaux Blanc),"A heavy dose of Sauvignon Blanc brings herbaceous, grassy, white currants and gooseberry flavors. It's young, and needs more time to coalesce. It is certainly fresh, fruity, right up front.",85
,Montresor 2003 Capitel della Crosara  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),"This wine doesn't seem to have fully evolved and its aromas are  muddled in places with notes of mature fruit and natural rubber. In the mouth it has red fruit flavors and tight tannins, but it generally lacks definition.",85
Roger Voss,Yvon Mau 2007 Premius Bordeaux Sauvignon  (Bordeaux Blanc),"This totally fresh wine has benefited from the quality of whites in 2007 Bordeaux. It is lemony with pink grapefruit flavors giving an intense lift. There is some herbaceousness, with green herbs and juicy fruits. To drink now.",85
,Bellenda 2005 Col di Luna Cabernet Sauvignon (Piave),"This is a northern Italian Cabernet with a light, informal style and low intensity. The wine delivers measured aromas of cherry, pine, cedar and ends with a crisp note of acidity.",85
,Breggo 2008 Gewürztraminer (Anderson Valley),"Off-dry, with sugary flavors of apricots, pears, flowers, vanilla and dusty Asian spices. Crisp acidity provides needed balance. Try with Vietnamese, Thai or Burmese fare.",85
Susan Kostrzewa,Byzantium 2005 Rosso di Valachia Red (Dealu Mare),"An intriguing nose of tobacco, mint, cherry and spice leads this earthy red. Flavors of spice, tobacco, red berry and tea are supported by ageable tannins and good complexity.",85
Michael Schachner,Pascual Toso 2007 Reserve Las Barrancas Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),"Coconut and dill aromas rise from the nose, and they are surrounded by berry, cassis and floral scents. The palate is tight, honest and a little hard, with middle-of-the-road berry flavors tinged with herbs. There's size and power to this wine, but also balance. Compared to previous years, it's a little less generous but still a good way to go.",88
Roger Voss,Quinta de la Rosa 2004 Late Bottled Vintage  (Port),"This is a sweet, rich Port. Its aromas are of soft berry jelly, with a ripe herbal character. To taste, it is concentrated, but the sweetness of the fruit masks its density. Berry and dried fruits make an attractive blend, leaving a firmer structure in the aftertaste.",88
,Sieber Rd 2007 Viognier (Barossa Valley),"While lacking the vibrant fruit typical of the variety, there are some attractive hay and honey scents on nose. The full-bodied and soft-textured palate is cloaked in vanilla, which lingers on the finish.",88
Paul Gregutt,Lachini 2007 Pinot Gris (Oregon),"This is a classic, high-acid vintage. The strength is fruit, and it's a mix of citrus and light pineapple; all stainless fermented and finished at moderate alcohol. Quite different in style from the '06, but well-made.",88
Michael Schachner,Mauro 2005 Red (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León),"Mauro will always show you a lot, but frankly this 2005 seems soft and chunky. It has rich, baked, black-fruit aromas and then a mildly syrupy palate with huge blackberry and cassis flavors. The finish is wide and rich, but where are the tannins and structure that this wine is known for? Drink now for best results; it may not improve in the cellar. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines.",88
,Dancing Bull 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (California),"Good price for a crisp white wine that's this polished. Nice on its own for the savory citrus, spearmint and spicy vanilla flavors, and fine with everything from fried chicken to Cantonese.",88
Roger Voss,Domaine de Mirail 2005 Les Mirlandes Red (Vin de Pays des Côtes de Gascogne),"A remarkably rich, spicy, attractive red. It obviously has new wood, but its use is judicious, leaving the mint, black berry and soft tannins of the fruit to come through well.",88
Roger Voss,Domaine des Terrisses 2006 Grande Tradition Red (Gaillac),"Made from Fer Servadou, Duras and Syrah, this is a wine with a truly local pedigree and a modern style, with prominent new wood. There are aromas that talk of wild heather and a dry landscape and palate notes of spice, ripe berries and prunes.",88
Roger Voss,Domaine du Tariquet 2007 Chenin Blanc-Chardonnay (Vin de Pays des Côtes de Gascogne),"A delicious wine, the Chenin Blanc giving both mineral and spice flavors, contrasting with the richer Chardonnay. Apricot and sweet melon flavors are supported by a fine, surprisingly complex structure. Fresh currants mark the refreshing finish.",88
Roger Voss,Fournier Père et Fils 2006 Les Belles Vignes  (Sancerre),"An enticingly perfumed wine, with its white flowers and apricot blossom. The palate is soft, rich, moving towards yellow fruits, ripe pink grapefruit and just an edge of mineral chalkiness.",88
,Benanti 2006 Edèlmio White (Sicilia),"Edèlmio is a sophisticated and toasty blend of Carricante and Chardonnay with fragrant aromas of stone fruit, peach, mineral, almond and freshly chopped pear. The wine is broad and generous in terms of its mouthfeel and would make a perfect companion to swordfish with mint and roasted eggplant.",88
,Caruso & Minini 2006 Terre di Giumara Syrah (Sicilia),"Here's a Syrah with bursting aromas of mature blueberry, cherry, spice and smoked bacon. The wine is full, round and generous with a supple feel and soft concentration. Pair it with lamb or roasted pork.",88
Joe Czerwinski,Yalumba 2006 Patchwork Shiraz (Barossa),"Blended from a patchwork of old vineyards throughout the Barossa, this is typical Barossa Shiraz, with plenty of weight and creamy tannins that support plummy, chocolaty fruit. There's a bit of spice for complexity and a crisp, fresh finish. Drink now–2014.",88
Paul Gregutt,The Four Graces 2007 Pinot Gris (Dundee Hills),"Rich in the mouth, this creamy and textural wine mixes fruit flavors of peach, apple and pear in equal proportion. It's a bit heavier than the previous vintage, with less of the floral character, but it offers, instead, a richness that lingers into a satisfying finish.",88
Paul Gregutt,Amity 2006 Riesling (Willamette Valley),"Creamy and textural, this brings on a nice mix of apple, pear and Key lime fruit flavors, fresh and pretty. Just a hint of minerality adds interest to the finish.",88
Paul Gregutt,Arcane Cellars 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rogue Valley),"Arcane's Cab is stylistically apart from either California or Washington. It defines its own space. There's plenty of new oak, but the fruit, acid and tannins stand up to it. This is sharp and tangy; cranberry and raspberry, strawberry and citric acids all playing their part. Still young, give it some time in a decanter or in your cellar to come together and show its best.",88
,Benanti 2005 Il Monovitigno  (Etna),"Nerello Mascalese, a grape native to the volcanic slopes of Mount Etna, delivers fresh berry notes that recall raspberry, blueberry and mulberry backed by toasted almond. There are pretty mineral nuances woven within its texture and the wine ends with polished tannins and menthol freshness. It is aged 12 months in oak, but you hardly taste the wood.",88
Paul Gregutt,Benton-Lane 2006 First Class Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Aromas of cherry, spice and mint lead into tart pie cherry and wild berry fruit, dusted with cocoa and spiced up with 16 months in French oak barrels. Unusual for most high-end Pinots, this is sealed with a screwcap.",88
Roger Voss,Château Puy-Servain 2003 Vieilles Vignes  (Montravel),The richness of vintage 2003  shows in this wine's layers of dried fruits on top of sweet tannins and a dense concentration. There is some licorice flavor arriving as the wine matures.,88
Roger Voss,Château Puy-Servain 2007 Marjolaine  (Montravel),"Full, firm white wine that gives good green fruit and pear flavors, lifted with spice from wood. The wine is round, while still retaining crispness from grassy acidity, and offers a good depth of plum skin structure and flavor.",88
Roger Voss,Domaine Philippe Portier 2007  Quincy,"A full, soft Sauvignon from close to Sancerre. There is a light, yeasty character to this young wine, but the fruit is all there—fresh pink grapefruit, lime and green berries. The finish is acidic and crisp, but still mouth-filling.",88
Paul Gregutt,Expression 44° 2006 Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"This bold, expressive Pinot Noir bursts open with spice, herb and leaf then rolls into flavors of vanilla cream and tangy red fruits. The spicy elements wrap into all the other flavors, giving lift and life; this is an exciting wine, though not necessarily one to cellar.",88
Roger Voss,Fournier Père et Fils 2006 Les Caillottes  (Pouilly-Fumé),"Concentrated, with white fruits, a strong streak of herbaceousness, green apples and a rich texture. The wine shows intensity as well as youth. It really needs another year before drinking.",88
,Nick Faldo 2005 Shiraz (Coonawarra),"Intense and focused, this good value Coonawarra opens with notes of leather and polished wood overlaid with red-berry fruit. Tannins are smooth, but there's plenty of lip-smacking acidity to keep the cherry cordial and plum fruit flavors lively. Drink now. Imported by Freixenet USA.",88
,Tarapaca 2006 Gran Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),"Denser and less herbal than the 2005 Gran Reserva, with fresh cassis and plum fruit to go with some chocolaty overtones. This has plenty of intensity and structure.",88
Paul Gregutt,The Four Graces 2005 Black Family Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"This is a very interesting wine. It has many different flavor threads that have not quite interwoven. To begin there is a surplus of acid, leaving a chalky sensation that has not yet smoothed out. The fruit flavors are also sharp and tart—red fruits from wild berries to pomegranate to sour cherry. The aromas suggest some light chocolate from the barrel aging, and it shows up in the finish, along with herb and vanilla. So, there's lots going on, but it has not yet come together in a harmonious whole.",88
,Hunt Country Vineyards 2007 Pinot Gris (Finger Lakes),"Unusually fruity for a Pinot Gris, this bursts with quince, hay and lanolin aromas that give way to an intense palate with good weight. While slightly astringent, the mouthwatering finish will provide a good foil for fried calamari.",88
Kerin O’Keefe,Antichi Vinai 1877 2013 Pietralava Red (Etna),"This ruby-hued blend of Nerello Mascalese and Nerello Cappuccio conveys aromas of bright berry, intense mint and a whiff of baking spice. The vibrant palate offers sour cherry, mineral and cinnamon flavors alongside fresh acidity.",88
Kerin O’Keefe,Baglio di Pianetto 2007 Cembali Nero d'Avola (Sicilia),"Aromas suggest oak, vanilla, bell pepper and cassis. The palate offers black cherry, cranberry, vanilla, mocha and oak alongside astringent, drying tannins.",88
Matt Kettmann,Brecon Estate 2012 Forty Two Red (Paso Robles),"This blend from a newer Westside Paso winery offers blackberry, charred pine and sour cherry aromas. The palate is driven by pine sap, charred game and sharp herbs such as oregano and rosemary, and would be a great way to spice up a steak dinner.",88
Matt Kettmann,Callaway 2010 Profonde Winemaker's Reserve Red (Temecula Valley),"A nice tarry funk along with dried mint and menthol cigarette scents characterize the nose of this blend of 63% Cabernet Sauvignon, 33% Syrah and 4% Petite Verdot. The creosote sense carries to the palate, meeting with black cherry, dried bouquet garni and quite grippy tannins.",88
Kerin O’Keefe,Casa di Grazia 2011 Gradiva Collectio Nero d'Avola (Sicilia),"Aromas of ripe dark berry, blue flower and a hint of baking spice waft from the glass. On the palate, notes of graphite, licorice and touch of smoke add depth to the ripe black cherry flavors. Firm tannins provide support.",88
Kerin O’Keefe,Casa di Grazia 2013 Zahara Grillo (Sicilia),"Citrus, yellow apple, orange blossom and saline aromas take center stage. On the palate, notes of savory herb accent creamy apple and pear flavors that are brightened by fresh acidity and a mineral note.",88
Roger Voss,Ruhlmann 2013 Vieilles Vignes Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"This wine is still young, showing spice and not yet enough fruit. It has the right weight and potential richness as well as concentration from the old vines. Drink this ageworthy wine from 2016.",88
Virginie Boone,Spring Mountain Vineyard 2011 Elivette Red (Napa Valley),"Estate bottled, this assemblage of 77% Cabernet Sauvignon, 13% Cabernet Franc and 10% Petit Verdot opens with a flurry of coconut flake and herb, followed by ripe, rich layers of dark berry and black tea. The wine has power yet also possesses an elegance that stands out, finishing with a taste of dark caramel.",88
Paul Gregutt,Stanton Vineyard 2013 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"Creamy and fresh, this is made from estate-grown grapes, fermented in a mix of stainless steel and neutral barrels. The fruit flavors blend jicama, melon and pear, with a touch of sweetness. It finishes with a hint of honeysuckle.",88
Michael Schachner,Terrazas de Los Andes 2012 Reserva Malbec (Mendoza),"Warm, earthy, jammy berry aromas are oaky and bring a note of latex into the fold. This chunky Malbec is tannic and grabby, with oaky flavors of black plum and vanilla set against herbal undertones. Spice, chocolate, carob and drawing tannins create a bold but rough finish.",88
Kerin O’Keefe,Cusumano 2013 Cubia Tenuta Ficuzza Insolia (Sicilia),"Made entirely with Insolia, this opens with subdued aromas of tropical fruit and white spring flower. The bright, linear palate offers passion fruit, peach, nectarine zest and a hint of ginger alongside crisp acidity.",88
Mike DeSimone,Dalton 2013 Alma Semillon-Viognier-Pinot Gris White (Galilee),"This offers aromas of honeydew melon and vanilla. On the palate, gentle flavors of nutmeg, cinnamon and eucalyptus predominate over a bright burst of citrus. Tannins are a tad bold for a relatively delicate white wine, but they are tempered by baking spice flavors that wash across the tongue and notes of tangerine on the back palate.",88
Roger Voss,Domaine Barmès-Buecher 2012 Pfleck Pinot Gris (Alsace),"The Pfleck vineyard with its clay and limestone soil gives a rich style of Pinot Gris. This wine, with its intense spice and lychee flavors, is typical. It has a crisp edge but the ripe fruitiness and touch of pepper give weight and richness. Drink now.",88
Matt Kettmann,Dragonette 2012 Vogelzang Sauvignon Blanc (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),"This is a softer Sauvignon Blanc for those not sworn to the grassy side of the grape, as the Buellton-based winery does a lot of barrel-fermenting. Aromas include pressed kiwi and a sour pucker of lime, and the broiled pear flavors prove easy drinking, if not exceedingly complex.",88
Paul Gregutt,Firesteed 2013 Pinot Gris (Oregon),"Smooth-drinking, this offers soft, mellow flavors of melon and pear. Light but persistent, it's a clean, fresh and appealing selection, best enjoyed now.",88
Paul Gregutt,Folin Cellars 2012 Estate Grenache (Rogue Valley),"The pretty fruit flavors suggest relatively young vines, bringing light cherry to the front and center. Hints of marzipan, a flash of finishing heat and subtle chalkiness run through the finish. Another year or two of bottle age should continue to improve this one.",88
Michael Schachner,Gaba do Xil 2012 Mencía (Valdeorras),"This lighter-bodied Mencía from Valdeorras shows exotic, minerally aromas of raspberry, blueberry and Middle Eastern spices. The palate runs crisp and fresh, but not real deep or intense. Flavors of raspberry, plum and schist finish dry and floral, with a touch of lasting oak.",88
Michael Schachner,Gorka Izagirre 2013 White (Bizkaiko Txakolina),"Clean, peachy aromas set up a light, minerally, citrusy body. Flavors of gooseberry, lime and lemon hold steady and double up on gooseberry on the finish. Overall, this is round, minerally and elegant, but also slightly sour and edgy.",88
Virginie Boone,Grgich Hills 2012 Miljenko's Selection Chardonnay (Carneros),"There's a substantial earthiness to this Chardonnay, grown in a relatively cool estate vineyard. Vibrant on the palate in ripe apple and lemon, it offers medium weight and body, with a crispness to the finish and a food-friendly nature.",88
Michael Schachner,Linaje Garsea 2010 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero),"Leathery cherry and cassis aromas are softened up by baking spice accents. In the mouth, this is hard-edged and pointed, with sharp, lemony acidity. Flavors of spiced plum and pie cherry finish with jagged acids and heat. This is a real enamel-peeler; more time in bottle can only help.",88
Joe Czerwinski,Omaka Springs 2013 Pinot Gris (Marlborough),"This is a soft, slightly sweet rendering of Pinot Gris, loaded with succulent pear, pineapple and melon fruit. Chill it well and sip it by the pool this summer.",88
Matt Kettmann,Ventana 2013 Chardonnay (Arroyo Seco),"Sea salt, Bosc pear, apple cider, squeezed lemon and shreds of vanilla frame a leaner nose on this wine from mid-Monterey County. The cider element carries to the rather pungent palate, proving quite high-toned and acidic with some minerality, grapefruit peel grip and long-lasting vibrancy on the finish.",88
Roger Voss,Vieil Armand 2010 Clos de la Tourelle Château Ollwiller Pinot Blanc (Alsace),"With its few years of aging, this is now a ripe and broad wine rich in yellow fruits that are cut with pear juice. It has nutty overtones, and a bright, crisp aftertaste.",88
Kerin O’Keefe,Viticultori Associati Canicatti 2012 Aquilae Nero d'Avola (Terre Siciliane),"This juicy, delicious red features aromas of red berry, Mediterranean brush and aromatic herb. The easygoing palate doles out ripe blackberry, crushed Morello cherry, a charred note and a touch of baking spice alongside smooth, supple tannins. Enjoy soon to capture the succulent fruit.",88
Kerin O’Keefe,Vivera 2010 Salisire Bianco  (Etna),"An attractive fragrance of white flower, stone fruit, apple and a whiff of smoke opens this linear wine. The bright palate offers dried citrus, Golden Delicious apple and mineral alongside brisk acidity.",88
Sean P. Sullivan,WildAire 2012 Spofford Station Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),"This wine offers notes of toasted vanilla bean, herbs and red fruit. It's broad in feel while the fruit flavors are elegant in style, with the supple feel bringing much of the enjoyment.",88
Joe Czerwinski,Mills Reef 2012 Gimblett Gravels Reserve Merlot-Malbec (Hawke's Bay),"This lacks a bit of midpalate richness, but otherwise offers fine drinking. Clove, cinnamon and leather complexities keep the cherry flavors interesting, while the finish is clean and crisp. Drink now.",87
Michael Schachner,Pazo Torrado 2013 Albariño (Rías Baixas),"Varietally correct aromas of peach and melon form a good opening to this mostly fresh but fading Albariño. Flavors of melon, papaya and peach are typical for the grape, and the finish is holding on but showing signs of maturation. Drink immediately.",87
Michael Schachner,Sur de los Andes 2012 Clásico Malbec (Mendoza),"Dark in color and forcefully oaked on the nose, this resiny Malbec will appeal to fans of richly styled reds. Plum, berry, tomato leaf and herbal flavors finish woody but fair, with lasting acidity.",87
Joe Czerwinski,Babich 2011 The Patriarch Premium Red (Hawke's Bay),"In marked contrast to the plush, sexy 2010, the 2011 Patriarch is a stern taskmaster. The aromas and flavors of cherry, cedar and dried herbs are pleasant, but carry with them a worring dry astringency. Try drinking this over the near term, with rare beef to help ameliorate the tannin's effects.",87
Michael Schachner,Rentas de Fincas 2003 Crianza  (Rioja),"A pretty decent Rioja for the vintage, but you're going to have to be ready for some rubbery aromas and then staunch red fruit with a little bite. It's quite the traditional wine, with lemon peel, leather and tobacco. Runs short on the finish.",85
Roger Voss,Setzer 2007 Vesper Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),"The lightest in a range of Grüner Veltliner from Hans Setzer. This is a green apple and grapefruit flavored wine, all lightness, freshness and crispness. There is a green plum skin tang to it, added to citrus.",85
,Tenuta Luisa 2007 Rive Alte Pinot Grigio (Isonzo del Friuli),"The wine boasts a pretty golden hue and segues to tones of almond skin, stone fruit, nut and cardboard. It feels smooth and rich in the mouth and has some tart citrus flavors on the close.",85
Paul Gregutt,Honeywood Winery 2006 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Far and away the freshest and most interesting of the three vintages submitted for review. The fruit retains more of its youthful gloss; it's riper and shows more cherry character, along with bright, spicy highlights. The tannins are proportionate and less earthy and herbal. This is no barn-burner, but it's a good quaffer.",85
,I Clivi 2004 Bianco degli Arzillari White (Colli Orientali del Friuli),"There's a saccharin or soda-like element to the nose of this Verduzzo-Friulano blend that gives the wine a cheerful, upfront personality but that overpowers the natural fruit. The wine tastes both tart and sweet and ends with butterscotch candy flavors.",85
,Irony 2004 Merlot (Napa Valley),"This is a pretty good buy for a Merlot that shows lots of polish and sophistication. It has savory black cherry, currant, cola and spice flavors. The tannins are a little rugged and green, so it loses some points.",85
Roger Voss,Kedar's K'orus NV Cabernet Sauvignon (Vin de Pays d'Oc),"Created by music industry businessman Kedar Massenburg (CEO Motown Records), the K'orus range is produced in the Languedoc. This Cabernet Sauvignon gives blackberry fruits, very juicy, lightly sweet to finish, but retaining attractive structure and acidity.",85
Roger Voss,Kedar's K'orus NV Chardonnay (Vin de Pays d'Oc),"Easy, creamy wine, with soft apple flavors and a touch of citrus. There is a light edge of toast to round out the soft, fleshy aftertaste.",85
,Little Black Dress 2006 Merlot (California),"Shows plenty of lush, ripe fruit, wrapped in soft tannins and balanced with crisp acids. The forward black cherry, red licorice, orange and smoky vanilla flavors are rich, and the price makes it a great value.",85
Michael Schachner,Marqués de Vizhoja 2007 Señor da Folla Verde White (Rías Baixas),"Quite leesy and funky, with meaty, oily aromas that are a departure from normal Albariño and are indicative of the 30% Treixadura and Loureiro that beef things up. Perfectly drinkable, and with a decent mouthfeel, but still it lacks the straightforward cleanliness of the really good wines from Galicia. Imported by Republic National Distributing Co.",85
,Estancia 2007 Pinot Grigio (California),"Estancia produces solid, savory Pinot Grigios at a fair price, and they even dropped their price last year. This one's a little off-dry, with crisp acidity and pleasant citrus, peach and honeysuckle flavors.",85
Michael Schachner,Finca La Emperatriz 2000 Reserva  (Rioja),"With tobacco, molasses, spearmint and baked fruit aromas, this finds itself squarely in the old school forum. The palate shows straight-ahead red fruit with light herbal and pepper accents. Snappy and a bit thin, but it offers all the basics.",85
,Vinai dell'Abbate 2006 Ribolla Gialla (Colli Orientali del Friuli),"Grassy and tonic with background shadings of white flower and stone fruit, this Ribolla Gialla offers aromas of white peach, kiwi and subtle hints of exotic fruit. The wine is crisp and lean in the mouth.",85
Roger Voss,Winzer Krems 2005 Sandgrube 13 Chremisa Zweigelt (Kremstal),"Beyond the spice of this cool-climate wine,  the flavors offer red berry fruits, fresh acidity and stalky tannins. It's soft, easy to drink now.",85
Roger Voss,Graf Hardegg 2007 Veltlinsky Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),"One of the original in the new generation of light, fresh Grüner Veltliner, Veltlinsky is a good example. With its green apple directness and smooth structure, it is a wine for the year, a fine apéritif or seafood partner. Screwcap.",85
Michael Schachner,Botalcura 2006 El Delirio Reserve Syrah-Malbec Red (Central Valley),"A little tart and pickled off the bat, with notes of rhubarb and red cherry along with a stronger, more evident blast of oak. The palate is fresh but sort of lean and wanting, with regular raspberry and plum flavors. Snappy but slightly sappy and resiny for what's on offer.",85
,Bridgeway 2004 Syrah (Central Coast),"This is the kind of wine someone serves at a big party, maybe in paper cups, along with the canapes, and you're delighted because it's actually pretty good. It's dry, soft and chocolaty, with a rich undertow of blackberries and currants.",85
,Calatrasi 2006 La Piazza Pinot Grigio (Delle Venezie),"La Piazza is a line of wine from Sicily's Calatrasi winery that uses fruit from various parts of Italy. This is their Pinot Grigio from northern Italy that tastes rich and creamy and is made in a New World style. Aromas revolve around butter, almond paste, peach and apricot. It doesn't have huge length, but it does taste rich and dense.",85
Roger Voss,Château Bélingard 2005  Monbazillac,"As in nearby Sauternes, 2005 produced some exceptionally rich botrytised wine in Monbazillac. This example from one of the leading Bergerac producers certainly shows plenty of richness, but it seems rather too sugary, showing toffee flavors and fatness. The acidity is missing.",85
Roger Voss,Clos Teddi 2007 Rosé Red (Patrimonio),"For those with a classical bent, Clos Teddi is named after Thetis, sea goddess and mother of Achilles. This rosé, appropriately, summons up lunch by the ocean, with its crisp, fresh, dry strawberry and pink grapefruit flavors, just touched by caramel.",85
,Colutta 2007 Friulano (Colli Orientali del Friuli),"Young spring flowers, lemongrass, green melon and dandelion come to mind and color what is a fresh wine with an easy, no-fuss approach. There's no big complicated story here, but that's exactly the point.",85
Susan Kostrzewa,Ormonde 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Darling),"Layered and rustic, this wine starts with aromas of tobacco and sausage and leads into spicy, dark fruit flavors. Vibrant with supple tannins, the wine needs some time.",85
,Principe di Corleone 2004 Evoè Red (Sicilia),"This is a ripe, slightly jammy blend of Nero d'Avola and Merlot with tones of cooked spice and blackberry pie. There are also some green leafy notes in the back backed by dense black tea that come as a surprise. You'll feel some grit on the palate and more fruit flavors on the close.",85
Roger Voss,Sandeman 2015 Quinta do Seixo Vintage  (Port),"Ripe and fruity, this is already delicious, but that doesn't detract from the firm tannins and density of a wine that will age well. It has all the elements, with the fruit, solid tannins and a juicy aftertaste. Drink from 2025.",94
Jim Gordon,Scott Harvey 2012 Old Vine Reserve Zinfandel (Amador County),"Composed, complex and complete, this mellow wine is very comfortable in its skin. Touches of oak, tobacco, dried plum and cardamom fill the aroma, and ripe but not overripe black cherry, tamarind and cola flavors flood the palate, supported by fine-grained tannins and medium-full body.",94
Virginie Boone,Sea Slopes 2015 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This wine offers astounding quality for the price, a juicy expression of fruit and spice with a depth of firm resolved tannin, lively acidity and layers of black cherry and cola. Approachable and delicious, it hits the mark on every level being light bodied and refreshingly balanced while complex.",94
Paul Gregutt,Trisaetum 2014 Family Reserve MMXIV Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"With its distinctive black label, this reserve is set apart from the winery's expanding lineup of Pinots. It shows more oak-derived flavors, along with ripe plum and cherry fruit. Streaks of espresso, vanilla and chocolate come through, suggesting it will only improve with a hearty decant or additional bottle age. Drink now through the mid-2020s.",94
Paul Gregutt,Bergström 2015 Bergström Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Sourced from the estate's original 1999 plantings, this is a chewy, majestic, earthy and deeply dark wine. Its black fruit is ribbed wtih iron, licorice, coffee and graphite notes and framed by earthy tannins that lend texture. It drinks bigger than its listed alcohol would suggest.",94
Paul Gregutt,Bergström 2015 Shea Vineyard Pinot Noir,"This single vineyard wine is a blend of six separate blocks, each planted to a different clone. It deftly combines savory herb flavors with ripe Bing cherry fruit. The tannins are polished, textured and balanced, leading into a long finish that leaves a final impression of composted earth.",94
Kerin O’Keefe,Mauro Veglio 2013 Castelletto  (Barolo),"This wine's enticing rose, blue flower, menthol and herb scents come together in the glass. On the taut, precise palate, tightly knit, refined tannins enwrap crunchy red cherry and juicy cranberry flavors. White pepper and clove notes add depth, while bright acidity lends balance. Drink 2023–2035.",94
Roger Voss,Poças 2014 Símbolo Red (Douro),"This is a major Douro wine from the Poças family-owned Port and wine producer. Dusty tannins already give it class as well as richness. Packed with black-plum fruits and with good concentration, the wine is still maturing. It needs to age further, so drink from 2019.",94
Roger Voss,Quinta do Vesuvio 2015 Vintage  (Port),"Full of ripe fruit, this wine is rich while also having a delicately perfumed character. With its spice, generous fruits and sense of poise, it will age well. Drink from 2027.",94
Joe Czerwinski,Schild Estate 2013 Moorooroo Shiraz (Barossa Valley),"Sourced from vines planted in 1847, this is a full-bodied, open-knit wine, supple and velvety in texture. Vanilla cream and black cherries mark the nose, while the flavors are more savory, resembling black olives and grilled meat. It's long and lush on the finish. Drink it now through 2025.",94
Virginie Boone,Shafer 2015 Red Shoulder Ranch Chardonnay (Carneros),"Always impressive in its grasp of power and grace, this white is memorable from start to finish, beginning with a dark golden-hay color that dazzles in the glass. A strong floral component of jasmine invites on the nose, while sparkling acidity maintains a freshness amidst the integrated oak and delicious flavors of honeyed pear and crème brûlée.",94
Roger Voss,Alphonse Mellot 2014 En Grands Champs  (Sancerre),"From old vines planted in a single vineyard, this is a spectacular red. It has the crisp acidity of the cool-climate Sancerre, but it also has the weight and ripeness of a fine Burgundy. The wood aging has left a spicy toasty edge to the beautiful cherry fruits and acidity. It could age for another year to be at its best. Drink from 2019.",94
Kerin O’Keefe,Ascheri 2013 Ascheri  (Barolo),"This savory, firmly structured, full-bodied red opens with subtle dark berry, rose petal, pipe tobacco and crushed herb aromas. It delivers layers of juicy Marasca cherry, black raspberry, cinnamon and clove flavors, buttressed by youthfully assertive but refined tannins and nicely balanced, with fresh acidity. Drink 2023–2033.",94
Paul Gregutt,Bergström 2015 Old Stones Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"Irresistably delicious and reminiscent of cru Burgundy, this laser-focused effort features bright Meyer lemon, tangerine and peach flavors, with plenty of juicy acidity. It grows deeper and richer as it breathes—and seems to disappear way too quickly once opened.",94
Paul Gregutt,Big Table Farm 2015 Elusive Queen Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"This winery is earning a place among Oregon's best with its top tier wines, like this one. Complex and loaded with bee pollen, crisp apple, lime zest, seabreeze and toasted cracker notes, it leaves you breathless the longer it breathes.",94
Paul Gregutt,Trisaetum 2016 Ribbon Ridge Estate Riesling (Ribbon Ridge),"As characterful as the dry version but with lower alcohol and a slight hint of sweetness, this boasts powerful tangerine, quince and Meyer lemon fruit. Its electric acidity keeps it vivid and beautifully balanced. Delicious now, it's also cellar-worthy.",94
Paul Gregutt,Trisaetum 2016 Wichmann Dundee Estate Riesling (Dundee Hills),"More tart than sweet, this delicious wine is packed with lemon drop, candied pineapple and tangerine fruit. The acidity is in perfect proportion with the slightly sweet palate, giving it a vivid mouthfeel that extends into the finish and offers versatility for food pairing.",94
Sean P. Sullivan,Horsepower 2014 The Tribe Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),"Lighter in color, this wine is aromatic and expressive, with notes of fire pit, blood, black olive tapenade, sea salt, black pepper, cured meat, nori, crushed flowers and umami. The palate brings soft, lithe, focused notes of earth and savory flavors that shimmer on the salty finish. It's all about delicacy but the aroma and flavor expression is compelling. Give it some time in the cellar or decant.",94
Virginie Boone,J. Davies 2013 Malbec (Diamond Mountain District),"Estate-grown, this 100% varietal wine impresses in its total embrace of succulent blackberry, plum and mocha goodness, built upon a mountain of structured tannin and quiet oak. Touches of milk chocolate play along the palate as it rides along a velvety roadway, finishing soft and silky.",94
Roger Voss,Château de Parnay 2014 La Coulée du Méridien  (Saumur-Champigny),"The Meridian in the name is the zero-longitude Prime Meridian which passes through this vineyard. The wine, with its minty flavors from new-wood aging, is serious, concentrated and with an impressive structure. The dark firm character of this wine promises plenty more aging. Drink from 2020.",94
Virginie Boone,Tres Sabores 2014 Perspective Estate Zinfandel (Rutherford),"From dry-farmed 40-year-old vines perched along the Rutherford Bench, this impressive offering is sanguine and elegantly balanced, a showcase of cranberry, raspberry and milk chocolate. Refined acidity contributes to an overall lightness, with dried herb and dust lingering on the finish.",94
Paul Gregutt,Trisaetum 2016 Coast Range Dry Riesling,"All Trisaetum's dry Rieslings feel a notch riper in this warm year, to good effect. Meticulous blending of individual lots, some aged in oak, brings layers of complexity and helps differentiate each cuvée. Concentrated pear, peach and papaya flavors are on display here, with tangy acidity and superb length and richness. It's dry, to be sure, but also brilliantly fruity.",94
Virginie Boone,Williams Selyem 2015 Terra De Promissio Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Smoky, with bursts of sage and celery root, this is a wine that is unabashedly earthy, spicy, bold and juicy at its core. Light-bodied and delicate, the palate shows beautiful floral undertones. This is a complex and beguiling bottling that should hold well for years to come.",94
Sean P. Sullivan,Cayuse 2014 Cailloux Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),"The aromas of this wine leap from the glass, with notes of orange peel, potpourri, smoked meat, spice, fresh herb, stem, ash and plum. It's expressive, but still wound up. The flavors are focused, concentrated and savory, bringing a sense of intensity and richness but also lightness. The balance is exquisite.",94
Virginie Boone,Chappellet 2013 Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley),"This is an impressively well-crafted, and beautiful wine, blended with 12% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Malbec, the main variety mountain-grown on Pritchard Hill. It shines in big, bold and powerfully built black fruit and leather. Dusty, firm tannins and a taste of graphite, coffee and tar are also highly evident. The finish is tart and seasoned in white pepper. Best enjoyed 2023 through 2033.",94
Roger Voss,Churchill's 2015 Quinta da Gricha Vintage  (Port),"Ripe, fruity and balanced, this has the potential to be a delicious, not-too-concentrated wine. Acidity and some dry tannins give the wine a firm character that is balanced by the fragrant berry fruits. Drink from 2026.",94
Virginie Boone,Cobb 2014 Emmaline Ann Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"From a three-acre spot known to get a hearty dose of fog, this wine speaks to cool-climate character, unveiling crisp floral layers of dried sage and white pepper from the get-go. Those aspects are joined by rose, lavender and cranberry-rhubarb on the palate, finishing with subtle offerings of mushroom and forest floor.",94
Paul Gregutt,Dion 2014 Old Vines Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"From vines planted in 1976, this aromatic wine shows the depth that old vines can bring. Strawberry, cola, butter (from 14 months in 50% new French oak), wild cherry and more come into focus, and although delicate, they last and last on the palate. The finish is spectacular.",94
Roger Voss,Domaine Bernard Fleuriet et Fils 2015 Anthocyane  (Sancerre),"Old-vine Pinot Noir has produced a rich structured wood-aged wine. With its opulent texture and ripe full-bodied cherries and red plums, the wine is poised and generous. Drink this impressive wine from 2018.",94
Paul Gregutt,Drouhin Oregon Roserock 2014 Zéphirine Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"This reserve-level wine from the Roserock vineyard, Domaine Drouhin's recent Eola-Amity Hills planting, is compelling. Dense and fragrant, it boasts a beguiling mix of rose, cocoa powder and Asian spice, like a magic carpet ride of flavor. A finishing note of chocolate-covered orange peel is the pièce de résistance.",94
Virginie Boone,Robert Mondavi 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"The winery shows its prowess with making delicious, affordable larger-production wines with this bright and easy drinking Cabernet, a study in soft tannins, juicy cranberry/currant fruit and composed structure. It's a good one to stock up on at the price and quality.",90
Michael Schachner,Santa Alicia 2012 Millantu Red (Maipo Valley),"Earthy red-fruit aromas come with hints of olive, herbs and spice. The mouthfeel on this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cab Franc and Carmenère is racy and layered. Flavors of herbal berry and spice finish long. Drink through 2018.",90
Paul Gregutt,Stevens 2012 StevensSweets Late Harvest Viognier (Yakima Valley),"This super-smooth late harvest effort is perfectly balanced among sugar/alcohol/acid components. Lively and rich, it offers concentrated flavors of limoncello, apricot and candied peaches. Drink it chilled for best effect.",90
Virginie Boone,Rutherford Ranch 2013 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"Creamy and well-integrated, this offers personality and style. The crisp bite of green apple and lemon curd are textured and long-lasting. With its overall balance, it is a fantastically versatile pairing option.",90
Matt Kettmann,Sextant 2011 Caverio G-S-M (Paso Robles),"With the scent of watermelon chapstick leading the way, this is a fruit-forward wine you want to kiss. Other aromas on the sweet-and-spicy nose include stewed plums and a dill-led herbal element. The flavors of red fruits and brown spice make for a completely delicious experience.",90
Michael Schachner,Valdivieso 2008 Éclat Vigno Old Vine Blend Red (Maule Valley),"Despite showing gritty, scratchy aromas of baked, earthy black fruits, this Carignan-led blend is rock solid and ready. Tight, punchy, focused acidity sets up a rustic palate with a mix of baked-fruit flavors, spice and char. A toasty, dark, long finish is staunch and sturdy. Drink through 2016.",90
Anne Krebiehl MW,Weixelbaum 2013 Wahre Werte Beerenauslese Chardonnay (Niederösterreich),"Wild thyme and moss blaze a savory trail before honeyed sweetness, cut by wonderfully precise, lemon-sharp acidity. This is linear and superclean, and that wonderful sweet-acid contrast should make this BA a winner both with the dessert trolley and the cheeseboard.",90
Virginie Boone,Landmark 2012 Charles Heintz Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"There's a ying-yang of rich crème brûlée, lemon curd and toasted oak amid good acidity and fresh apple and pear fruit, with inviting aromas to boot. Creamy and crisp it'll serve well aside all manner of seafood, like fresh-caught trout.",90
Paul Gregutt,Mercer 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Yakima Valley),"With alcohol in the low-moderate range, this immaculately fresh wine is flush with juicy gooseberry and grapefruit. It carries the varietal hallmarks of fresh herbs, notably chive, and a balancing lick of minerality.",90
Joe Czerwinski,Michel Gassier 2012 Les Piliers Syrah (Costières de Nîmes),"This is as perfumed an example of Syrah as you'll find from the Southern Rhône. Hints of herbs, spice and violets accent blueberry fruit in this charming wine. It's medium in body—not that rich but or layered but supple, silky and easily accessible. Drink this through the end of 2015.",90
Kerin O’Keefe,Nada Fiorenzo 2011 Nebbiolo (Langhe),"Intense aromas of blue flower, red berry and licorice lead the nose on this full-bodied wine. Menthol, licorice, cake spices and a blast of orange zest complement the juicy, red cherry and black raspberry flavors.",90
Paul Gregutt,Barrage Cellars 2010 Outcast Cabernet Franc (Yakima Valley),"Boushey and Red Willow are the vineyards that contribute to this 100% varietal Cabernet Franc. There's excellent concentration to the brambly, bright, blackberry fruit, and some sharp acidity to underscore it. It's pure varietal and should continue to improve 2019–2021.",90
Jim Gordon,Berryessa Gap 2011 California Series Zinfandel (Yolo County),"Fresh, gushing fruit flavors such as raspberry, red cherry and boysenberry fill out this expressive and well-balanced wine. It is sweetly fruity in aroma, full-flavored, full-bodied, firm and dry in texture but not heavy. It craves ribs or wood-fired pizza.",90
Matt Kettmann,Bonny Doon 2010 Le Cigare Volant Red (Central Coast),"Distinct crushed lava rock aromas meet with dust, cinnamon, cola and Dr Pepper on this blend of 28% Syrah, 22% Grenache, 17% Cinsault, 17% Mourvèdre and 16% Carignane. Light red fruits of cranberry and slight strawberry show on the palate that dives into serious tannins quickly.",90
Kerin O’Keefe,Carpineto 2006 Sant'Ercolano  (Vino Nobile di Montepulciano),"Black currant, bell pepper and leather aromas lead the way on this blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon. The dense palate delivers ripe black cherry, grilled pepper, mocha and cracked black pepper alongside bracing tannins.",90
Michael Schachner,Casajús 2011 Antiguos Viñedos  (Ribera del Duero),"With a black color and deep, resiny aromas of licorice, baking spices and black fruits, this is a big, Tempranillo with plenty of size and tannic bite. Flavors of earthy, oaky, loamy plum and blackberry finish with licorice, spice and baked notes. Drink through 2018.",90
Michael Schachner,Castellroig 2010 Reserva Brut Nature Sparkling (Cava),"The nose falls somewhere between smoky and gritty, while dusty white-fruit scents prop things up. Peachy acidity and citric tang let you know this is a “nature” Cava, while nectarine, rhubarb and green-herb flavors finish razor crisp and dry.",90
Joe Czerwinski,Château d'Or et de Gueules 2010 Les Cimels Red (Costières de Nîmes),"Dense almost to the point of chewiness, this is a concentrated blend of Syrah, Carignan and Grenache. Earthy, plummy notes pick up hints of dark chocolate and licorice before ending rich and velvety.",90
Sean P. Sullivan,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2013 Horse Heaven Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Horse Heaven Hills),"Coming from the warm 2013 vintage, this is an aromatic offering, with notes of pineapple, kiwi, herbs and oak spices (40% barrel fermented). It's creamy in feel, but with tart, vibrant acidity that keeps the palate fresh and lively.",90
Kerin O’Keefe,Citille di Sopra 2012  Rosso di Montalcino,"Opening with aromas of underbrush, perfumed berries and crushed violets, this balanced Rosso displays its pedigree. The savory palate delivers dense wild cherry layered with orange peel, white pepper, mocha and cake spices alongside supple tannins. Energizing minerality signals the close. Enjoy now–2017.",90
Michael Schachner,Condado de Oriza 2008 Reserva  (Ribera del Duero),"This 2008 holdover shows a mix of jammy, composed berry aromas as well as staunch notes of dried cheese and leather. The palate is firm at first, then more loamy and layered. On the flavor profile, baked berry blends with brine and cardamom, while on the finish this ready-to-drink RDD delivers licorice and earthy baked notes.",90
Jim Gordon,Cookies & Cream 2010 Merlot (California),"One of a string of great values made at Terravant near Santa Barbara. Attractively oaky, it's full-bodied, full-flavored and just tannic enough to make it a good pairing for rich meat or cheese courses. It is deep in color, with a slightly tawny rim. It smells like wood smoke and grilled bread, tastes deep as blackberry and delivers cherry flavors that linger on the finish.",90
Matt Kettmann,Daou 2012 Reserve Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"Rich cherry and spicy black pepper introduce the nose to this wine from the Adelaida district. The flavors explore the more nuanced, not overly jammy side of the grape, with tart acidity and a good tannic backbone ensuring a long life. Decent now, but better to drink 2018–2022.",90
Kerin O’Keefe,Dei 2012  Rosso di Montepulciano,"Ripe black plum, forest floor, mint and spice notes lead the nose on this savory, medium-bodied red. The succulent, straightforward palate doles out fleshy black cherry and crushed raspberry accented with black pepper and clove alongside round tannins. Drink through 2015.",90
Roger Voss,Domaine de Gensac 2011 Quadrille White (Gers),"A blend of white Bordeaux and local Gers grapes, this is a smooth, medium sweet wine. With three years of aging, it has become mature, rich in smoky flavors as well as dried apricot and bitter oranges. Acidity keeps everything in line. It's ready to drink.",90
Roger Voss,Domaine Rolet Père et Fils 2008 Brut Sparkling (Crémant de Jura),"Chardonay and Pinot Noir are both present in this apple and pear flavored wine. A lively mousse brings out the fruit and acidity, giving a tangy, bright wine that's ready to drink now.",90
Roger Voss,Domaine Rotier NV Noces de Feu Duras (Vin de Liqueur),"This wine came out of the disaster of shriveled Duras grapes after an especially hot period. Rather than discarding them, Domaine Rotier made a wine. Wood aged, it has many of the characters of a late harvest with its rich, sweet, lightly tannic flavors and sufficient acidity to balance. A surprising success.",90
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Three Brothers 2014 Zero Degree Dry Riesling (Seneca Lake),"While ebulliently peachy and floral on the nose, savory notes of dried reeds and savory herbs overwhelm the fruit flavors in this dry, light-bodied Riesling. It's crisp and refreshingly composed, but finishes a bit short. Drink now.",84
Sean P. Sullivan,Wilridge 2014 Dessert Wine Estate Wilridge Vineyard Pinot Gris (Naches Heights),"Red apple, spice and honey aromas lead to medium-sweet fruit flavors. It brings some appeal but the concentration doesn't seem all there.",84
Sean P. Sullivan,Wilridge 2014 Vintage Estate Dessert Wine Wilridge Vineyard Red (Naches Heights),"This wine is an unusual blend of Touriga (38%), Tinto Cão (20%), Tempranillo (18%), Petit Verdot (15%) and Souzão. Alcohol aromas show prominently along with dark fruit. The fruit flavors seem dried out, juxtaposed by the sweetness of the wine, with the tannins having a real sense of grip.",84
Virginie Boone,Belden Barns 2013 Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Sonoma Mountain),"This wine is tightly wound and thickly colored. Full bodied in style, it shows plenty of oak influence, aged in entirely French oak for 16 months, 42% of it new. Cranberry and sour cherry dominate in terms of fruit, with an underlying agenda of clove and tea.",84
Roger Voss,Château du Retout 2013  Haut-Médoc,"Based in the heart of the Haut-Médoc, this property has produced a wine that shows a dry character, with bitter extraction and too much wood. There are just hints of juicy fruit that will need time to come through. It could well stay dry and firm always.",84
Roger Voss,Château la Gravette Lacombe 2013  Médoc,The producer has probably used too much wood for the fruit and density of this wine. The toastiness does not allow any fruit to show through.,84
Roger Voss,Château Méric 2013  Médoc,"This wine is lean with acidity playing over the red-currant fruits, leaving a character that's light and tight. While the wine will soften it's not likely to show any more weight or richness.",84
Michael Schachner,Apaltagua 2014 Reserva Malbec (Maule Valley),"Prickly aromas of juniper and cherry are sharp and lean towards green. This Malbec feels tight and lean, while plum and herbal aromas qualify as basic. A light, racy finish pinches and tastes generic.",84
Virginie Boone,In Re 2011 You be the judge! Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is a challenging mix of substantially puckering tannins and herbaceous notes, dotted in black peppercorns. The fruit is elusive.",84
Joe Czerwinski,Chasing Venus 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"Despite some ripe, honeyed aromas, this is light in body and quite lean on the palate. Underripe pineapple flavors show a tart, herbal edge on the finish.",84
Roger Voss,Château les Joyeuses 2014  Bordeaux,"This soft, jammy and fruity wine is ready to drink, with black-currant flavors that are ripe and rounded. Only the lightest tannins gives any structure to this wine that is immediately accessible.",84
Roger Voss,Château Monfort Bellevue 2012  Médoc,Too enthusiastic use of wood has left this wine bereft of fruit and unbalanced.,84
Roger Voss,Château Vrai Caillou 2013  Bordeaux Supérieur,"This wine is structured and stalky without the fruit weight, reflecting the difficult vintage. A smoky character comes through the acidity to leave a dry aftertaste. Through 2016, it will soften a little, although always missing the fruit. The blend is 55% Merlot, 25% Cabernet Ssauvignon and 20% Cabernet Franc.",84
Michael Schachner,Concha y Toro 2015 Reserva Casillero del Diablo Sauvignon Blanc (Chile),"Prickly aromas of nettle are simple as well as diluted. This feels basic and fresh, while green, citrusy flavors end with pithy notes and an oily feel.",84
Virginie Boone,Experience 2012 Red (Napa Valley),"This Zinfandel-dominant blend also contains Cabernet Franc and Petite Sirah in sizable amounts, rounded out by a handful of Merlot. Relatively light bodied, it has a muted nose. The flavors lean towards overripe, more dried fruit than fresh.",84
Kerin O’Keefe,Cantine Grasso 2014 Nero d'Avola (Terre Siciliane),"This easygoing, simple red offers hints of dark berry flavors while a note of dark spice fleetingly appears in the background. It's uber-informal and rather diluted with a short but clean finish.",84
Kerin O’Keefe,Grifalco 2014 Frà Rosato (Basilicata),"This informal rosato offers delicate aromas and flavors of wild red berry and blood orange. It's rather lean and diluted, with bracing acidity.",84
Virginie Boone,Madrigal 2012 Las Viñas del Señor Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),An uncomplicated combination of red and black berry bramble with an overlay of coconut shavings provides a ripeness of fruit atop sweetened tannins and dull oak in this wine. It's made to be medium bodied and enjoyable now.,84
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Millbrook 2013 Proprietor's Special Reserve Chardonnay (Hudson River Region),"Pronounced notes of butter, cheese and canned cream corn dominate this savory Chardonnay. It's a rather fat, cream-textured wine but sunny tangerine acidity and fresher notes of apple and pear flavors do get a peek through the midpalate.",84
Michael Schachner,Santa Rita 2014 Medalla Real Gran Reserva Chardonnay (Leyda Valley),"Aromas of corn and melon are waxy and oily. This feels pinched and juicy, but not crisp or minerally. Stalky flavors of corn, citrus and apple lean towards bitter, as does the finish.",84
Jim Gordon,Scotto Family Cellars 2012 Chardonnay (Lodi),"Aromas like green apples and lemons, and herbal flavors make this wine refreshing and balanced toward the lean side. It's rather light bodied and crisp in texture.",84
Jim Gordon,Spicy Vines 2011 Sacrlet's Flirtation Zinfandel (Mendocino),"After 34 months in previously used French barrels, this wine has a brownish rim. It smells like pepper, clove and cinnamon and tastes like dried fruit. Considerable tannins contribute to an astringent mouthfeel.",84
Virginie Boone,Kirkland Signature 2012 Meritage (Napa Valley),"This Meritage is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, with smaller additions of Malbec, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. Tasting quite ripe, it has a burnt sage and cedar undertone. Tannins hit on the back of the palate with power and not much finesse.",83
Roger Voss,Les Vignerons Réunis de Monségur 2014 La Tour du Gouverneur  (Bordeaux),"This fresh wine has plenty of acidity as well as some firm tannins. It is still young, waiting to fill out with riper fruit flavors. The aftertaste just repeats the acidity.",83
Kerin O’Keefe,Nugnes 2014 Rosato (Campania),"With the pale color of onion skin, this rosé has muted aromas of damp earth and dried rose petal. The lean, diluted palate reveals suggestions of red berry alongside brisk acidity.",83
Sean P. Sullivan,Barnard Griffin 2013 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The aromas of cinnamon, kelp, and dried fruit are unusual and don't seem in harmony. The gamy flavors bring some appeal but don't entirely come together.",83
Kerin O’Keefe,Cantine Grasso 2013 Caporosso Nero d'Avola (Sicilia),"This lean red initially opens with a sulfur aroma that burns off to reveal steeped prune, dried violet and a hint of resin. The diluted, fleeting palate offers hints of black cherry and walnut skin.",83
Roger Voss,Château les Lattes 2013  Médoc,"Lean and tannic, this wine has chocolate and bitter coffee flavors from over-extraction. The fruit is suppressed at this stage, with a bitter aftertaste.",83
Michael Schachner,Concha y Toro 2014 Reserva Casillero del Diablo Carmenère (Central Valley),"Blocky, stewy, raisiny aromas of nonspecific black fruits are jumbled and green. This feels awkward and jammy, with little to no structural integrity. Flavors of prune, raisin and oak finish soft and loamy.",83
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Ports of New York NV Meleau White Specialty Wine White (New York),"Coffee grinds and caramel mingle with hints of popcorn and dried herbs in this curious blend of white grapes which have been aged Sherry-style in a solera. Whiffs of dried fruit and caramel are enticing, but the palate juxtaposes craggy acidity with mouthfeel that's dampening and flat.",83
Paul Gregutt,Whitman Cellars 2004 Narcissa Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is spicy and sharp, with high-toned fruit flavors of berry and currant. Acids are strong and provide good focus, with a spicy/peppery note resonating through the finish.",87
Roger Voss,Winkler-Hermaden 2007 Steierische Klassik Weissburgunder (Südoststeiermark),"The focus of this full, rounded, soft Pinot Blanc is on the pear flavors. The mineral texture is about easy-drinking freshness allied to attractive acidity.",87
Joe Czerwinski,Fire Block 2004 Old Vine Shiraz (Clare Valley),"This wine boasts admirable complexity, but comes across as a bit angular, with the acids maybe a touch too prominent. Still, the flavors of mint, pepper and meat layered over plum and raspberry fruit offer a lot to like, and the acids may actually make this wine more versatile with food than many more unctuous Shiraz.",87
Susan Kostrzewa,Palivou 2006 White Fox Roditis (Corinth),"The White Fox is a refreshing, crisp white that offers a balance of acidity, spice and creamy pear flavors. There's body and the wine has weight without being heavy, its lemon acidity keeping it aloft.",87
Roger Voss,Felsner 2007 Rohrendorfer Leithen Alte Reben Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal),"Manfred Felsner obviously enjoys the spicy character of Grüner Veltliner, because, like all his wines from this varietal, this has spice in spades. But it also has good fresh acidity, which emphasizes the green fruit character of the wine, bringing out the crispness of the year. Screwcap.",87
,Gemella 2005 L'Anima Petite Sirah (Mendocino),"Old vine Petite Sirah fortified with brandy in the Port style, this very sweet wine could benefit from some time in the bottle. It's quite rich in chocolate, black currant and spice flavors wrapped into smooth, thick tannins, with a burn of alcohol on the finish.",87
Roger Voss,Gunter Triebaumer 2006 Blaufränkisch (Burgenland),"A big, ripe wine, full of berry fruits and rhubarb, edged with tannins, spice and red plum skins. It has a juicy, rich quality, enhanced by acidity, and rounded with vanilla. Keep for a year. Screwcap.",87
Roger Voss,Gunter Triebaumer 2006 Spätlese Traminer (Burgenland),"This highly aromatic, softly sweet wine brings together lychees, mango and pear-skin flavors, given freshness from acidity. Light, poised, delicate, it leaves a delicious lift.",87
Susan Kostrzewa,Tsantali 2006 Ambelonas at Agios Pavlos White (Halkidiki),"The bone-dry, earthy minerality of Assyrtiko blends well with the crisp, fresh fruit flavors of Sauvignon Blanc in this white blend. Clean, simple flavors of citrus, spice and slate give the wine a quaffable, food-friendly edge.",87
,Bisol NV Desiderio Jeio Brut  (Prosecco del Veneto),"There's a distinctly mineral, almost ashen quality to this wine that recalls talcum powder and schoolroom chalkboard. The wine is linear and defined and has very pungent, almost sharp, effervescence with drying minerals on the close and will keep the palate polished and clean.",86
,Carmina NV Extra Dry  (Prosecco di Conegliano),"This Prosecco Extra Dry has a subtle, easy approach with measured fruit intensity but recognizable sweetness in the form of silky honey and melon. It offers a good measure of cleaning effervescence and chewy fruit to keep it going.",86
,Carpenè Malvolti NV Cuvée Oro Dry  (Prosecco di Conegliano),"Delicate and sweet, this pretty Prosecco offers delicate floral notes and shadings of banana and exotic fruit. It is light and foamy in the mouth with full, soft texture and sensual sweetness on the close.",86
,Col Saliz NV Servo Suo Dry Vendemmia Tardiva  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene),"Simple peach aromas characterize this Prosecco Dry with a creamy, frothy cap, pretty bubbling and measured aromas of fruit salad and kiwi. The wine comes alive in the mouth thanks to its pretty mineral tones and generous fruity sweetness: Made from late-harvest Prosecco grapes.",86
,Ghost Pines 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa-Sonoma),"From Gallo, a two-county blend with some real elegance and style. The Cab is dry, soft and full-bodied, with lingering blackberry, currant, licorice and spice flavors. Drink now.",86
,Wellington 2004 Estate Merlot (Sonoma Valley),"With its peppery spices and briary, brambly notes of ripe wild berries, this wine tastes more like Zinfandel than Merlot. It's not true to the variety, but it is a solid red wine, dry and full-bodied.",86
,Zonin NV Special Cuvée Brut  (Prosecco del Veneto),"Here is a very clean and pristine Prosecco Brut with measured but distinct notes of white peach, acacia flower and chopped kiwi. The wine tastes creamy and slightly sweet with chewy peach flavors. It makes a perfect aperitif wine.",86
Paul Gregutt,Lost River 2005 Cedarosa Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"In keeping with the winery's other red wine releases, the Cedarosa matches tart berry fruits to lush barrel flavors of butter and toast. It's approachable and somewhat monolithic.",86
,Toffoli 2007 Millesimato Extra Brut  (Prosecco del Veneto),"Tonic and lean, this foamy sparkler delivers aromas of stone fruit, honey and yellow flower. It's a delicate, feminine wine with characteristic almond-like sourness on the close.",86
Michael Schachner,Trapiche 2007 Broquel Chardonnay (Mendoza),"Apricot and oak aromas make for a smoky, slightly heavy bouquet. The wine keeps that weightiness as it passes from nectarine to citrus to tropical fruits. Long on the finish, with integrity. But it's also a bit citric in the center. “Pulpy” is another descriptor.",86
Joe Czerwinski,Louis Guntrum 2006 Niersteiner Bergkirche Kabinett Riesling (Rheinhessen),"Despite weighing in at 12% alcohol, this seems light in body and sweet in style, with honeyed pineapple aromas and flavors of apple skin and lime. Finishes stridently, with a dusty texture.",86
,Pali 2006 Durell Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"A little heavy and ripe for a Pinot Noir, this bottling shows pie-filling flavors of cherries, blackberries and currants, with a candied chocolate-covered mint sweetness. It also seems overly soft. Drink now.",86
,Robert Stemmler 2005 Nugent Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Stemmler's record is spotty with this bottling. This '05 is a little too ripe, soft and heavy, but the chocolate-inspired red currant, cola and licorice flavors are lip-smackingly good.",86
Michael Schachner,Rutini 2006 Trumpeter Merlot (Mendoza),"Toast and char sit atop the bouquet like a heavy king on his throne, but there's nothing fake or weak about it. The color is dark and the palate is round; flavors of black plum, figs and black olives convey a meaty, true personality amid all the char, chocolate and vanilla. A good wine in the massive category that is value-priced Merlot.",86
Roger Voss,Schloss Halbturn 2006 Koenigsegg Velt. 1 Grüner Veltliner (Burgenland),"Fresh, crisp, citrus and floral flavors make a light, easy Grüner Veltliner, a great summer drink of light white fruits and green berries. Screwcap.",86
,Spagnol NV Col del Sas Extra Dry  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene),This is textbook Prosecco Extra Dry with sweet fragrances of stone fruit and white flower backed by mineral shadings and delicious honey. The wine is simple with lively acidity on the close.,86
Roger Voss,Wines & Winemakers 2015 Lua Cheia em Vinhas Velhas Rosé (Douro),"Made from old vines, this rich rosé is full of fruit. It has fine acidity as well as wild-strawberry flavors. The texture, lightly mineral, gives the wine a crisp, tight shape. With a fresh aftertaste, the wine will be just right for food.",88
Michael Schachner,Zolo 2014 Reserve Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Valle de Uco),"Aromas of blackberry and briar patch expand to include violet notes. In the mouth, there's pulpy weight to the fruit and rubbery tannins for framing. Rugged but generic black-fruit flavors finish with toasty darkness and some burn.",88
Roger Voss,Bailly-Lapierre NV La Burgondie Rosé Brut  (Crémant de Bourgogne),"Packed with red fruits and crisp acidity, this lively wine has a tight mousse, while the red-currant fruitiness adds intense acidity. The wine is bright and ready to drink.",88
Jim Gordon,Balo 2014 Pinot Gris (Anderson Valley),"Honeylike aromas, ripe peach and apple flavors and rather full body give this wine good depth and breadth. It seems like just the thing for a picnic or to serve with cheese at a party.",88
Kerin O’Keefe,Bel Colle 2013 Montersino  (Barbaresco),"Aromas suggesting dried rose petal, woodland berry, chopped mint and kitchen spice come together on this. The tight palate isn't quite as expressive as the nose, offering sour cherry, tart cranberry and a hint of clove alongside bracing tannins that grip the finish.",88
Joe Czerwinski,Beresford 2014 Beacon Hill Sauvignon Blanc (South Australia),"Beyond a hint of stuck flint on the nose, this offers clean, varietally correct aromas and flavors of white nectarine, grapefruit and gooseberry. It's nicely balanced in the middle of the spectrum, offering a harmonious mix of stone fruit and citrus.",88
Kerin O’Keefe,Boasso 2012 Margheria  (Barolo),"Underbrush, singed earth, mature dark-skinned fruit and a balsamic note emerge in the glass. The ripe, firm palate shows mocha, black raspberry and licorice as well as a slightly green note of raw sage. A backbone of bracing tannins provides the tight framework.",88
Kerin O’Keefe,Broccardo 2012 I Tre Pais  (Barolo),"This opens with aromas of oak, toast and espresso that carry over to the firmly structured palate along with herb and dried black cherry. Austere tannins clench the finish.",88
Roger Voss,Casa Agricola Santos Jorge 2012 Herdade dos Machados Reserva Red (Alentejo),"A rich full wine that has swathes of black fruits. It has a dry core around which there are generous fruits and the right amount of acidity. Perfumed, ripe and concentrated, this is ready to drink now.",88
Roger Voss,Cave des Vignerons de Buxy 2014  Mâcon-Villages,"This tangy wine has attractive acidity and a tightly coiled mineral texture. Apple and lemon flavors shoot right through the bright, crisp texture. Drink from 2017.",88
Mike DeSimone,Chamlija 2014 Papaskarasi (Thrace),"From a winery that specializes in this rare variety, this single varietal Papaskarasi has a nose of cherry, strawberry and freesia. It is bright on entry, and then smooth tannins and a sense of coolness take over the palate among flavors of cherry, menthol, cranberry and juniper berry.",88
Roger Voss,Château de Fuissé 2014  Saint-Véran,"From vines in the northern part of the appellation, this ripe wine conveys peaches and apricots laced with lime. A vibrant, mineral wine with swathes of fresh acidity, it can be drunk now.",88
Roger Voss,Château de Santenay 2014  Chassagne-Montrachet,"This rich wine is full and has a good balance of acidity and fruit. The lightly mineral texture gives bite and crispness. It is still a young, tight wine needing another few months. Drink from 2017.",88
Jim Gordon,Chime 2013 Chardonnay (California),"Crisp green-apple freshness blends with hints of butter and vanilla for a nicely balanced, un-oaky, medium-bodied wine at a very reasonable price.",88
Roger Voss,Christophe Cordier 2014 Vers Cras  (Pouilly-Fuissé),"Spicy, fruity and attractive, this balanced wine has acidity, tight minerality, yellow fruits and a richer texture. Full bodied and generous, it will age well. Drink from 2017.",88
Roger Voss,Famille Laplace 2015 Aramis Rouge Tannat-Syrah Tannat-Syrah (Vin de France),"Made to be drunk young, this is a soft, ripe and fruity wine. It has a juicy blackberry flavor, plenty of acidity and a soft, smooth aftertaste. Drink from 2017.",88
Michael Schachner,Finca Lalande 2015 Malbec (Mendoza),"Olive, saucy berry and a sense of rawness on the nose drive this Malbec towards a solid but slightly scratchy feeling palate. Plum, blackberry and minty oak flavors are short and lightly herbal, while this ends without much force.",88
Michael Schachner,Altos Las Hormigas 2013 Appellation Gualtallary Malbec (Mendoza),"Rubbery, gaseous initial aromas give way to piquant red-fruit notes. This feels lean, racy and very high in acidity. Limited flavors of currant, tomato and salty red plum finish with herbal notes and persistent saltiness as well as abrasive acidity.",87
Michael Schachner,Antucura 2011 Calcura Red (Vista Flores),"Leathery aromas of horseradish and stewed berries lead to a rooty, syrupy palate. Flavors of cola, chocolate and raisin are creamy as a whole. This tastes ripe on the finish, with raisin and oxidized notes. This Merlot-Cabernet-Malbec blend has its strong points but comes across baked and raisiny.",87
Paul Gregutt,Aubichon Cellars 2014 Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"Though aged in neutral oak, this wine opens with scents and flavor hints of toast and butter. The fruit is clean and generic, like a fresh apple, but the mouthfeel lacks life and fades into a flat finish. Drink up.",87
Kerin O’Keefe,Battaglio 2013 Serragrilli  (Barbaresco),"This opens with aromas of menthol, coconut, oak, overripe black cherry, leather and exotic spice. The bracing palate shows dried black cherry, clove, ground pepper and a green note of powdered sage alongside assertive grainy tannins.",87
Joe Czerwinski,Ben Haines 2015 B Minor Marsanne-Roussanne (Goulburn Valley),"At less than 13% abv, this is on the lighter side of the Rhône white spectrum, offering simple pear and toasted marshmallow aromas and flavors that finish lean and crisp.",87
Joe Czerwinski,Beresford 2014 Beacon Hill Pinot Grigio (South Australia),"This is plump and custardy in feel, but still refreshing thanks to bright apple and lime aromas and flavors. It's more citrus than apple on the crisp finish.",87
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Blue Fish 2015 Original Riesling (Pfalz),"Whiffs of sugar cookies and raspberries entice on this consistently pleasing bargain buy. Fruity and floral and a just shade off dry, its an easygoing wine but with a depth beyond what one might presume from its cheeky packaging. Finishes on a lingering white peach note.",87
Roger Voss,Bouchard Père & Fils 2014  Pouilly-Fuissé,"Fresh, crisp and fruity, this is an immediately drinkable wine. It has great freshness, lively acidity and perfumed apple fruitiness. The acidity cuts through brightly and leaves a vibrant, textured aftertaste.",87
Alexander Peartree,Brennan 2014 Tempranillo (Texas),"There's a solid concentration of red and black berries to the nose of this wine, with tar and soy sauce giving depth. Solid tannic grip on the palate offers support to the array of dark cherry and blackberry alongside sandalwood and smoke.",87
Jim Gordon,Cambridge & Sunset 2014 California Series Zinfandel (California),"This wine is very good in a ripe, almost-sweet style. It smells and tastes like blackberry pie, has full fruit flavors and a smooth, rich texture without noticeable tannins.",87
Roger Voss,Casca Wines 2015 Cascas Winemaker Selection Red (Lisboa),"Syrah, Castelão and Aragonez go into the blend of this rich juicy wine. It is so soft and ripe, just hinting at tannins and with red-berry fruit. The wine is round and smooth, ready to drink.",87
Kerin O’Keefe,Cascina Chicco 2012 Rocche di Castelletto  (Barolo),"This offers aromas suggesting cherries marinated in spirits, underbrush and a whiff of camphor while the firm but rather lean palate offers grilled herb, licorice and a note of sour cherry. Astringent tannins grip the finish.",87
Paul Gregutt,Coelho 2014 Apreciação Estate Vineyard Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"There's a touch (17%) of new oak here, which adds flavors of caramel and vanilla to the rather tart and simple fruit. It falls into the generic yellow/green apple style, with hints of arugula.",87
Kerin O’Keefe,Poderi Colla 2013 Bussia Dardi Le Rose  (Barolo),"Truffle, underbrush, new leather and chopped herb aromas slowly emerge in the glass. The bright, elegantly structured palate delivers tart cherry, licorice and tobacco alongside vibrant acidity and tightly wound noble tannins. It's still youthfully austere so give it time to develop. Drink 2023–2033.",93
Roger Voss,Quinta da Foz 2016 Reserva Red (Douro),"Old vines, many up to 80-years-old, supply the grapes that were fermented in traditional granite lagars for a ripe jammy character in this powerful wine. It has solid tannins and great acidity, both of which will allow the wine to age. Drink this impressive wine from 2020.",93
Jim Gordon,Roederer Estate NV Estate Bottled Brut Sparkling (Anderson Valley),"This is an assertive, flavorful and robust wine, with a medium to full body, a mouthfilling texture and fine-beaded bubbles. A creamy viscosity and wonderful layers of butter, apple, vanilla and ginger make for a delicious palate.",93
Virginie Boone,St. Francis 2014 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"Black in color, this heavy concentrated wine is thick in black pepper and clove, with underlying streaks of cedar.

Virginie Boone,Tamber Bey 2014 Vermejo Deux Chevaux Vineyard Red (Yountville),"This blend works in commingling 58% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Merlot, 17% Cabernet Franc and 4% each of Malbec and Petit Verdot, all from the producer's vineyard.

Matt Kettmann,Tantara 2015 Dierberg Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Dark purple flowers and tart boysenberry paste show on the nose of this intensely concentrated wine, alongside pencil shavings, bay lead and a lot of iron minerality.

Matt Kettmann,Westerly 2013 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Dark and deep aromas of black cherry, clove, allspice, black pepper and char make for a hearty impression on this appellation blend. The palate is also rich and powerful, its thick mouthfeel showing black cherry, cocoa, vanilla and a touch of asphalt. A rocky minerality and minty finish complete the experience.",93
Virginie Boone,Aesthete 2016 Dry Stack Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Bennett Valley),"Complex and composed, this vineyard-designate wine is brightly decorated in flavors of grapefruit pith and lemon zest, with zippy acidity.

Roger Voss,Bacalhôa Wines of Portugal 2014 Quinta dos Quatros Ventos Red (Douro),"This estate whose name means four winds is in the Douro Superior, the easternmost part of the Douro region. It is intensely rich and solid—a classic blend for the region with a dominance of Touriga Nacional and Touriga Franca, aged in wood and with plenty more aging ability. This black-fruit-flavored wine will be best from 2020.",93
Matt Kettmann,Barton 2013 Paradise City Syrah (Paso Robles Willow Creek District),"From the Barton family's estate vineyard, this is a very dark Syrah with aromas of blackberry, balsamic, lavender and thyme flowers.

Kerin O’Keefe,Bava 2014 Piano Alto Barbera,"Alluring aromas of dark-skinned berry, exotic spice and an earthy note of tilled soil come together in the glass.

Kerin O’Keefe,Bucci 2014 Villa Bucci Riserva  (Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi Classico),"Alluring aromas of beeswax, white spring flower and acacia float from the glass. On the vibrant palate, crisp acidity offsets yellow apple, Anjou pear and nectarine while the slightest hint of paraffin graces the dry finish.",93
Matt Kettmann,Central Coast Group Project 2013 Fauve Thompson Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"Scott Sampler's experimentation with extra long macerations seem to imbue even more of a sense of place to his wines. In this case, that translates to very purple aromas of grape Jolly Ranchers, violet oil and warm black licorice. An exotic Indian-candy spice shows on the tip of the sip, leading into rich blueberry and fresh purple-flower flavors, with coffee and cocoa on the finish.",93
Roger Voss,Château Tour Grand Faurie 2009  Saint-Émilion,"This smooth, rich and fine wine is maturing well. It has a good balance of ripe fruit and acidity. Bitter coffee and spice notes add complexity while not detracting from the fruit. Drink from 2020.",93
Matt Kettmann,Fess Parker 2015 Pommard Clone Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Lilacs and wisteria combine for a floral and approachable nose in this clonal study, which is also loaded with clove, peppercorn, rosemary and elderberry aromas.

Roasted lamb flavors also make an appearance against tannins that rise up in the finish.",93
Virginie Boone,Iron Horse 2013 Rainbow Cuvée Sparkling (Green Valley),"After three years en tirage, this well-evolved wine is heady and floral, made to highlight and celebrate diversity. Creamy and lush on the palate, it has a rounded richness of stone fruit. Made predominantly from Pinot Noir, it has an accentuated taste of strawberry shortcake.",93
Roger Voss,J. Portugal Ramos 2014 Marquês de Borba Reserva Red (Alentejo),"The Reserva version of the popular Borba brand in Portugal is a dense, powerfully tannic wine. Its juicy black currant and blackberry fruits are suffused with tannins—its dry core surrounded by richness. Hints of dark chocolate and pepper come from the alcohol but certainly don't take away from the great fruitiness of the wine. Drink from 2019.",93
Jim Gordon,Judd's Hill 2014 Charbono (Suisun Valley),"What a treat to find a great rendition of this rare varietal. Concentrated black-fruit flavors pair beautifully with aromatic oak accents in this bold and complex wine. It has plenty of tannins to support the intense blackberry and blueberry flavors, while enticing cinnamon, cumin and leather come up in the aroma and last through the lingering finish.",93
Virginie Boone,Longboard 2015 Rochioli Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Dark gold in color, a strong note of apple skin gives way to tight acidity on the entry of this wine. As it develops in the glass, it becomes plush and fleshy, imparting complex elements of candied quince and orange blossom.",93
Matt Kettmann,Piro 2015 Points West Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Marc Piro continued to hone his craft under Jim Clendenen at Au Bon Climat, and that expertise shows in this bottling, which combines Presqu'ile and Bien Nacido Vineyards to produce a wine that's both zesty in the underripe style yet full of fruit as well.

Matt Kettmann,Point & Line 2015 Reserve Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"This elegant bottling by two service-industry veterans shows tons of potpourri, dried lavender, black raspberry and red plum on the nose. The flavors are quite broad and inviting, with hibiscus and ripe tomato meshing into juniper and clove. It's light in mouthfeel and weight, but well structured.",93
Roger Voss,Secret Spot Wines 2014 Crooked Vines Colheita Red (Douro),"This producer specializes in seeking out parcels of old vines. In this case, the vines, planted at high density, have unusually crooked trunks. The wine itself, richly tannic and dense, has new wood flavors, ripe black-plum fruits and a dark firm character. It is still young and will develop into an impressively rich wine. Drink from 2019.",93
Matt Kettmann,Tantara 2015 La Encantada Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Elegant and beautiful aromas of Montmorency cherry, tart orange peel and balsamic fig reduction sauce prove precise and show some mature vine age. Roasted fig flavors meet with salt and pepper seasonings on the palate, which is well structure and full of bright acidity.",93
Jim Gordon,White Hart Wine 2014 Vasthoudend Red (Monterey),"Extreme concentration combined with a velvety texture make this inky-dark wine made from Tannat and Dornfelder compelling to taste. The color is black with a thin ruby rim while black cherry, cedar and tobacco fill the aroma and crème de cassis meets espresso on the palate. The mouthfeel is polished as very fine-grained tannins blend with a rich viscosity.",93
Virginie Boone,Artesa 2014 Tempranillo (Alexander Valley),"From the Carneros-based producer with its roots in Spain, this succeeds in its velvety smooth texture, juicy fruit and supportive acidity. Black licorice and spiced plum are given additional richness by a jolt of dark chocolate.",92
Virginie Boone,Balletto 2015 Sexton Hill Vineyard Estate Grown Estate Bottled Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"With a fruity exuberance of crisp cranberry and red cherry, this wine delights in touches of nuanced herb and earth. Light bodied and refreshing, it maintains elegant complexity and depth, a lovely example of site and winemaking.",92
Matt Kettmann,Bien Nacido 2014 Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Earthy aromas of turned soil meet with dark red currant and a layer of smoke on the nose of this estate bottling by the historic vineyard. Strawberry, smoked pork and a touch of lavender show on the sip, which rides a strong acidity that arises in the midpalate and persists deep into the finish.",92
Matt Kettmann,Bodega de Edgar 2014 Toro de Paso Red (Central Coast),"Very roasted notes of coffee, warm leather, tobacco leaves, sagebrush and stewed blackberries show on the nose of this blend of 70% Tempranillo, 20% Grenache and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon. The roasted quality carries through the sip, with more coffee and char tones alongside dried plums, crushed gravel and dusty tannins.",92
Matt Kettmann,Cambria 2015 West Point Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),"This new project focusing on specific blocks of the historic Cambria Vineyard on the Santa Maria Bench starts with very subtle and restrained aromas of nectarine, lemon cream and a hint of grapefruit pith. The palate is fresh with lime and toasted coconut flavors, held up by a backbone of strong acid that keeps it from spilling toward overripe qualities.",92
,Agricoltori del Chianti Geografico 2007 Geografico  (Chianti Classico),"Pretty concentration and deep saturation set the stage for penetrating aromas of blackberry, exotic spice and chopped green herbs. This is a rich Sangiovese (with 10% Canaiolo) with bright freshness and lingering spice on the finish.",88
Roger Voss,Barrière Frères 2006 Jacques Sans Souci  (Bordeaux),"A wine that aims to bring out the casual side of Bordeaux, this is friendly, accessible, without losing the essential dry tannins and fresh black currant flavors typical of the region. If only all branded Bordeaux was like this.",88
,Castellare di Castellina 2005 Riserva  (Chianti Classico),"There's an interesting note of honey or maple syrup that gives this Riserva a uniquely smooth and supple style. Fruit aromas recall dried prunes, fig and currants. The wine offers elegant, fine texture in the mouth.",88
Roger Voss,Château la Grande Barthe 2003  Montagne-Saint-Émilion,"Yes, it has 2003 ripeness, but there is also some restraint here. The tannins are still defiantly young, the fruit packed with black plum jelly flavors. It promises 2–3 years' aging.",88
Paul Gregutt,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2007 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Here is a solid, widely distributed, well-priced, all-purpose Chardonnay. It's got plenty of buttery toast, soft and round fruit—lightly peachy—and unusual richness for a wine in this price range. It's a California style with a Washington twist—real acid.",88
Susan Kostrzewa,Danie de Wet 2008 Limestone Hill Chardonnay (Robertson),"This wine has a delicate nose of citrus and spicy nuts, with robust, round flavors of apple, citrus and spice. Balanced acid and fruit means the wine has complexity, but is still refreshing. Mouthwatering and food friendly, the Chardonnay has added class.",88
Joe Czerwinski,Dr. Wehrheim 2007 Buntsandstein Weisser Burgunder Kabinett Trocken Pinot Blanc (Pfalz),"This medium-bodied dry white is prettily aromatic, showing hints of orange blossom, pineapple and pear upfront, then building on the base of fruit with hints of wet stones and a dry, almost chalky finish.",88
,Erba 2005 Mountainside Vineyards Proprietary Red Wine Red (Napa Valley),"Tasted at the age of 38 months, Erba's Bordeaux blend is a dense, tannicly dry wine. It has well-ripened flavors of blackberries, currants, mocha and cedar. If you drink it now, decant. Best before 2011, before the fruit falls out.",88
Susan Kostrzewa,Mulderbosch 2006 Noble Late Harvest Sauvignon Blanc (Stellenbosch),"This delicate, elegant NLH wine starts with alluring aromas of lush honey, apricot and citrus and offers a vibrant, lively balance of fruit and acid. Pair with cheeses and fruit salads.",88

Approachable and balanced, the wine will pair well with seafood and chicken dishes.",88
Paul Gregutt,Sol Duc 2005 Goose Ridge Estate Vineyard Meritage Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This superpremium effort from Precept Brands is loaded with fruit, and crafted with winemaker Charlie Hoppes' trademark style—lush oak, giving generous barrel flavors of butterscotch and toast. The barrel flavors dominate, complemented by bold black cherry, blackberry and cassis fruit.",88
Paul Gregutt,Horan Estates 2005 HVH Red Blend Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Cabernet Sauvignon-dominated, the blend also includes about one third Merlot and a splash of Syrah. Tight and somewhat reductive when first opened, it slowly unwraps into a substantial effort, dense with berry, cherry and cassis concentrate. Some not-quite-integrated green tannins remain, and the buttery finish also wants more bottle age. But a good effort overall.",88
,Lamole di Lamole 2005 Riserva  (Chianti Classico),"Spice, cherry cola and dried lavender emerge from the nose of this classy Riserva. The wine has elegance, harmony and a long finish thanks to the quality of its fruit and the natural acidity. Pair it with lasagna or meat-filled ravioli.",88
Joe Czerwinski,Leo 2007 X-treme Riesling (Pfalz),"Pretty standard dry Riesling but done well, marrying bold fruit aromas of apple, pear and melon with undercurrents of spice and minerality. It's medium-bodied, harmonious and shows excellent persistence on the finish.",88
Joe Czerwinski,Villa Wolf 2007 Silvaner (Pfalz),Silvaners rarely boast this kind of charm and forward fruit. This one combines apple and citrus notes into a round yet crisp package with overtones of pineapple. This should make a refreshing summer sipper.,88
Paul Gregutt,Washington Hills 2006 Chardonnay (Washington),"The blend includes 6% Pinot Gris. This is a crisp, well-crafted bottle of wine, with more flesh and fruit than the Pine & Post Chardonnay from Precept Brands. Melon, pear, and orange fruit is accented with a little honey; this is a big step forward for this brand.",88
Paul Gregutt,Washington Hills 2007 Summit Reserve Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Definitely a step up from the regular Chardonnay; this is more substantial, bringing in some mineral, citrus rind and spice along with apple and pear flavors.",88
Susan Kostrzewa,Guardian Peak 2007 Merlot (Stellenbosch),"This wine has a rich, velvety character that gives it solo sipping appeal. Pepper and mocha on the nose flow into dark fruit and mocha flavors on the palate. Paired with a good structure and long finish, the wine is both elegant and intriguing.",88
,Bell 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Bell's basic Cabernet often is a good buy, and the 2005 certainly falls into that category. It shows polished Napa structure, with savory cassis and cedar flavors. Drink now through 2011.",88
Michael Schachner,Cameron Hughes 2004 Lot 93  (Rioja),"Cameron Hughes bottles dozens of wines from California growers, and now he's expanded to include Rioja and Campo de Borja in Spain along with South Africa. This wine is made in the full-throttled, modern style. There's copious oak, toast and darkness on the bouquet, and then full-bodied black plum, raspberry and spice flavors. Quite a bulky, oaky style, but also one endowed with chocolate, nuttiness and depth.",88
,Caparzo 2004 Vigna La Casa  (Brunello di Montalcino),"This special selezione Brunello delivers big ripe fruit flavors—almost too ripe—of blueberry, strawberry and red currants. The wine has power and heft with more flavors of spice, leather, tobacco and gritty tannins.",88
Michael Schachner,Venta Morales 2010 Tempranillo (La Mancha),"Bramble and red berry aromas are attractive and almost exotic. Feels a bit furry and scratchy, but tastes of blueberry with an herbal tinge. Finishes well, with a pinch of minty green flavor.",85
,Firriato 2010 Santagostino Baglio Sorìa White (Sicilia),"This blend of Catarratto and Chardonnay shows a tiny touch of oxidation, with butterscotch and caramel aromas behind candied fruit, apricot and pineapple. The mouthfeel is soft, thick and sticky.",85
,Fondo Antico 2009 I Versi Red (Sicilia),"Plump, lively and packed tight with cherry and blackberry, this blend of Nero d'Avola and Merlot would pair well with grilled sausage or hamburgers. The mouthfeel is soft, easy and fresh.",85
Virginie Boone,Hannah Nicole Vineyards 2010 Viognier (Contra Costa County),"This wine opens sweet, smelling of lemon and grapefruit, and is appropriately creamy in mouthfeel, with a sliver of sweetness on the finish.",85
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Hosmer 2010 Riesling (Cayuga Lake),"Floral and fruity, with abundantly ripe peach and melon flavors, this semidry Riesling is juicy and sweet without being cloying. Penetrating fruit flavors ease off on the midpalate on the way to a dainty, sugar-laced finish.",85
,Ancient Oak Cellars 2007 Siebert Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Soft and sweet, this Pinot has simple but appealing raspberry, cherry, cola and spice flavors. It would score higher if the texture was more potent.",85
Lauren Buzzeo,Barkan 2010 Classic Merlot-Argaman (Dan),"This 50-50 blend is easy and drinkable now, with a soft structure of delicate red fruit flavors, light tannins and moderate acidity. An herbal, almost leafy character adds depth to the bouquet. Drink now.",85
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Black Star Farms 2010 Arcturos Riesling (Michigan),"Waxy floral and lemon skin notes are elegantly subdued on this concentrated semidry Riesling. Juicy on the palate with abundant peach preserve flavors, it finishes moderately long with on a slightly drying, tea inflected note.",85
,Cosentino 2007 The Franc Cabernet Franc (California),"Soft, sweet and fruity, tasting like a granola bar, with roasted almonds, raspberry filling and cinnamon spice.",85
,Cusumano 2010 Insolia (Sicilia),"Cusumano's fresh Insolia delivers a steady, neutral nose with distant aromas of honey, Golden Delicious apple and dried grass. It's a lean, simple wine at a competitive price.",85
Michael Schachner,Lusco 2010 Albariño (Rías Baixas),"Opens with peachy, citric and saline aromas. Feels moderately fresh, but seems as though it's starting to mature as it's fleshy and pithy. Flavors of nectarine, orange and bitter pith are good but lack that ethereal quality that can make Albariño special. Drink now.",85
,Markham 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"There are solid Cabernet flavors of blackberries and black currants in this dry, tannic wine. It's rough and astringent in the mouth, without much charm, but a rich steak, maybe topped with a gorgonzola sauce, will make it shine.",85
Virginie Boone,Michael David 2009 Earthquake Petite Sirah (Lodi),"Whoa... need... water. Michael David's Earthquake is all about impact, no bones about it. And this one won't disappoint people who like their wine like finely aged Scotch, high in alcohol. For them, its bold smoky chocolate, savory bacon on toast notes will be delightful.",85
,Maggiovini 2008 Pithoi Nero d'Avola (Sicilia),Pithoi opens with light aromas of forest berry and raw fruit backed by touches of spice and bitter almond. It's an easy wine that could pair with pizza or take-out fried chicken.,84

,Masseria del Feudo Grottarossa 2009 Haermosa Chardonnay (Sicilia),Haermosa is made with organically-farmed fruit. It shows milky notes of peach yogurt and white chocolate. But it also shows zesty crispness on the close despite the thickness and fullness of the wine's overall texture.,84

,Petroni 2007 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),"Rugged and astringent in texture, with jammy blackberry and spice flavors.",84
,Petroni 2010 Estate Grown Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma Valley),"There's a minty, ammonia streak of greenness that can charitably be described as gooseberry in this dry Sauvignon Blanc. Oak brings sweet vanilla richness, but the wine is still pretty eccentric.",84
,Resonata 2010 Nero d'Avola (Sicilia),"This simple Sicilian red delivers bright berry fruit, blue flower and white almond skin. It shows almost Pinot Noir-like aromas and the power and gritty mouthfeel usually associated with Nero d'Avola.",84
Roger Voss,Aveleda 2010 Praia White (Vinho Verde),"A just off-dry Vinho Verde, fresh and spritzy. Acidity, sweet apples and a breezy citrus edge combine easily and lightly. Ready to drink.",84
Michael Schachner,Bodegas Fontana 2010 Mesta Tempranillo (Uclés),"A bit scratchy up front, with some heat and rubber to the bouquet. Feels bold, grippy and alive, with lightly herbal flavors of roasted berry and leather. Herbal and blackened on the finish; ripe but basic in quality.",84
Michael Schachner,Bodegas Peñafiel 2006 Miros de Ribera Crianza  (Ribera del Duero),"On the plus side, the wine is exotic and different, with blueberry, herbal notes, juniper and roasted aromas. But in the mouth, it's lean to the point of being thin, with sharp acidity and tight red plum, pie cherry and herbal flavors. Short on the finish, with tang and scour.",84
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Brotherhood 2010 Riesling (New York),"Stunning aromatically, with a veil of smoke and petrol that lingers over fresh, clean Honeycrisp apple aromas. Semidry in style, with a simple, slightly sugary attack, it finishes with just a tinge of green pepper in the backdrop.",84
,Calatrasi 2010 Terrale Oro Nero d'Avola (Sicilia),"Terrale Oro is a perfect pasta or pizza wine to drink on nights at home with family and friends. It delivers bright red fruit, blackberry and almond paste.",84
Roger Voss,Cave de Lugny 2010 L'Aurore  (Mâcon-Villages),"A crisp, lemon-scented wine, then layering on butter, toast and ripe melon fruit flavors. It's immediately attractive, not needing any aging, with a soft, yet fresh, finish.",84

Virginie Boone,Ghost Waltz 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),"Much of the fruit for this wine came from Alexander Valley and it represents the appellation well, combining the ability to be juicy and approachable with powerful tannins and the potential to age. Cassis, raspberry and black pepper are standout characteristics, and the wine is big, but balanced.",89
Kerin O’Keefe,Griesbauerhof 2013 St. Magdalener Classico Red (Alto Adige),"Made with 95% Schiava and 5% Lagrein, this sleek red opens with aromas of red currant and crushed violet.

Kerin O’Keefe,Cantina Produttori San Michele Appiano 2011 Sanct Valentin Pinot Nero (Alto Adige),"Aromas of dried rose, violet and red berry meld together in the glass. The refined palate offers dried cherry, light toast, mineral and a hint of spice alongside soft, supple tannins.",89

Michael Schachner,Clos Figueras 2013 Serras del Priorat Red (Priorat),"Rubbery berry and plum aromas come with a note of latex. In the mouth, this is juicy, bright and focused, with good raspberry and plum fruit. Textural balance is an attribute, while the finish is round, lively and full of tasty berry flavors. Drink through 2018.",89
Matt Kettmann,Consilience 2013 Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County),"This wine's nose begins very steely, with fresh cracked chalk aromas, then allows soft caramel candy, pound cake and white flowers to emerge. The very inviting flavors include apple flesh and skins, fresh cut pineapple and slated nuts, all clinging to a very pithy element that cuts the entire palate.",89
Roger Voss,Domaines Landron 2013 La Louvetrie Sur Lie  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine),"Ripe and fruity, this immediately attractive wine has a crisp texture, giving prominence to apple and grapefruit freshness.

The linear palate delivers yellow apple, citrus, thyme and a hint of mineral alongside brisk acidity.",89
Jim Gordon,Cedar Creek 2011 Estate Grown Syrah (Fair Play),"This complex, flavorful wine walks on the wild side with a bit of funky barnyard in the aromas and flavors. It's dry, moderately tannic, rather light in body, and brings spicy black pepper, grilled beef and ripe plum flavors.",89

Roger Voss,Domaine de l'Ermitage 2013  Menetou-Salon,"Lightly herbaceous, this is a ripe, lively wine. Grapefruit and lemon zest flavors are complemented by fuller apple and quince flavors. A tight minerality in the background will allow the wine to age. Drink from 2016.",89

Anna Lee C. Iijima,Dr. Fischer 2013 Ockfener Bockstein Kabinett Riesling (Mosel),"Spine-tingling acidity runs throughout this off-dry Riesling.

Michael Schachner,Pinord 2007 Chateldon Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Penedès),"Rusty in color and earthy on the nose, with capped aromas of cedar and herbs, this mature Catalonian Cabernet is compact on the palate and fused by firm tannins. Flavors of dried berry, stone fruits and toffee finish long. This ranks as a fun challenge for Spanish wine geeks.",89
Paul Gregutt,Purple Hands 2013 Holstein Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Light, tart cherry fruit beckons for further exploration. The ripeness is there, and the wine comes across as clean and elegant in its modest proportions. As it breathes open there is a slight hint of volatility which, for most tasters, will be a plus.",89

This tangy wine is developing well, and is ready to drink now although it will age.",89
Virginie Boone,Rosenblum 2011 Monte Rosso Vineyard Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"This Zin speaks to compelling red fruit, plum and vanilla, with light oak presence.

Virginie Boone,Summers 2013 Stuhlmuller Vineyards Reserve Chardonnay (Alexander Valley),"Floral, this medium-bodied white is creamy and touched by richer notions of pear, pineapple and vanilla, reflective of its warmer appellation in a warm year.

Kerin O’Keefe,Vesevo 2016  Greco di Tufo,"Radiant and elegant, this offers enticing white stone fruit, Mediterranean brush and spring flower scents. The vibrant, balanced palate delivers creamy white peach, pear and tangy nectarine flavors, alongside crisp acidity. A savory mineral note gives it a mouthwatering finish.",90
Virginie Boone,Viszlay Vineyards 2013 Estate Petite Sirah (Russian River Valley),"A bright, floral fragrance invites one to further explore this softly structured wine. It's layered with ripe red fruit, leather and pepper flavors that are carried into the finish by tight, grippy tannins.",90

Anne Krebiehl MW,Zahel 2016 White (Wiener Gemischter Satz),"Slight reduction still obstructs this wine's nose. The palate, however, is both zingy and rich—spiked with citrus and rounded with ripe, mellow apple fruit. There is verve and life at its core and tone to its medium body. The dry finish is appetizing.",90
Michael Schachner,Albet I Noya 2013 Brut Natural Reserva Sparkling (Penedès),"Focused crisp aromas of white fruits reflect a cool vintage. This is roughly one-quarter each Macabeo, Parellada, Xarello and Chardonnay, and it feels tight, fresh and focused.

Anne Krebiehl MW,Allram 2016 Strassertaler Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),"Freshly cut pear, ivy leaf and spice mark the nose of this wine. The palate is slender but juicy, full of citrus-fresh fruit. It's all about joy and drinkability, feeling more structured and serious on the clean finish.",90
Michael Schachner,Alta Alella 2013 Privat Gran Reserva Brut Nature Sparkling (Cava),"Briny cidery aromas are fortunately not that loud or intense. This is wide and generous on the palate, with dry briny stone-fruit and apple flavors. A sense of dryness and pickle brine is amplified on a purposeful finish.",90
Virginie Boone,Ampelos 2013 Ampelos Vineyard Syrah (Sta. Rita Hills),"Made from 100% estate grapes, this wine is shy in aroma but happily light and bright on the palate. It's delicate yet framed by firm tannins, showing blueberry and toasty oak flavors and nuanced acidity.",90
Matt Kettmann,Ascencion 2014 Mayhem Syrah (Paso Robles),"Tangy boysenberry and elderberry fruit shows on the nose of this sultry bottling, along with thyme, potpourri and licorice.

Michael Schachner,Baigorri 2015 Blanco Fermentado en Barrica Viura (Rioja),Waxy lightly toasted aromas of yellow apple are more subtle than popping. This barrel-fermented wine offers good weight and balance along with quiet flavors of spiced apple and vanilla. A sophisticated clean finish is lightly oaked in flavor and smooth in feel.,90
Joe Czerwinski,Carrick 2015 Bannockburn Chardonnay (Central Otago),"This plump, medium-bodied Chardonnay shows yellow fruit notes of mirabelle plum, peach and pineapple, all wrapped in a cocoon of woodsmoke. Drink now–2020.",90
Matt Kettmann,Challen 2014 Scarlett Pinot Noir (Sta.

Roger Voss,Château Grand Boise 2015 Red (Côtes de Provence Sainte-Victoire),"From organically grown grapes, this firmly structured red wine is stalky while also rich with potential. It is young, dense with tannins as well as black-currant fruit. The wine will need to age, so drink from 2019.",90

Roger Voss,Clos Fardet 2013 Tannat (Madiran),"Pascal Savoret is the only producer with vines actually in the village (as distinct from the appellation) of Madiran, a mere population of 430.

Virginie Boone,Crux 2013 Syrah (Russian River Valley),"Meat, compost and leather notes mark the entry of this Syrah blended with smaller amounts of Mourvèdre and Petite Sirah. Light black pepper and red fruit flavors are sustained by a soft, round texture and lingering finish.",90

Roger Voss,Domaine Harmonie des Arpents 2016 Rosé (Coteaux Varois en Provence),"This is a ripe, full and fruity wine. It is packed with attractive red-berry fruits and a crisp dry backbone. The acidity and the bright aftertaste make it a fine food rosé. It comes from a small appellation surrounded by the large Côtes de Provence area.",90
Roger Voss,Domaine Sainte-Marie 2016 Paparazzi Rosé (Côtes de Provence),"Produced from organic grapes, the wine is ripe and packed with fruit. It has a delicious line of acidity, as well as weight and peach and red-fruit flavors. The acidity keeps the exuberance in check. Drink now.",90
Anne Krebiehl MW,Domäne Wachau 2016 Terrassen Federspiel Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),"Fresh Conference pear notes abound on the nose of this wine. The palate is sprightly and fresh, with a zestier core of lime and pear peel. Slender in frame, it dances on the palate, displaying seriousness and levity at the same time. The finish is totally refreshing.",90
Virginie Boone,Doren 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),"Blackberry and chocolate flavors intertwine nicely in this soft, round and bright red from a tiny site in the appellation. Lightly spiced with clove and cedar, it strikes a balance between fruit and tension, making it a food-friendly option that won't overpower in the glass.",90
Matt Kettmann,Écluse 2014 Rendition Red (Paso Robles),"Damp chaparral, dried blueberry, beef and pencil lead scents show on the nose of this blend of 54% Grenache, 35% Syrah and 11% Mourvèdre.

Kerin O’Keefe,Feudo Montoni 2016 della Timpa Grillo (Sicilia),"Spanish broom, yellow stone fruit and citrus zest aromas take shape in the glass. Lively acidity carries juicy nectarine, intense lemon, thyme, pineapple and Mediterranean herb flavors into the round, juicy finish.",90
Paul Gregutt,Grizzly Peak 2015 Viognier (Rogue Valley),"Intense and loaded with scents and flavors of fully ripe fruit, this parades down the tree fruit and tropical fruit avenues, with peach, apricot, papaya and mango in the lead. It's a delicious bottle, with just enough acidity to keep it bright and lively.",90
Michael Schachner,Tilia 2011 Bonarda (Mendoza),"This is herbal and clipped smelling, with a scattering of berry and plum notes. It feels saturated and chewy, with roasted berry, pepper and spice flavors that lead to a lightly herbal finish, with a rubbery accent and a baked fruit note.",86
,Villa Mottura 2011 Le Pitre Rosato (Salento),"An easy-drinking rosato, this has dusty aromas of dried rose petal, stone fruit and citrus. The mouthfeel is clean, lean and crisp.",86
Paul Gregutt,14 Hands 2010 Riesling (Washington),"Regrettably, this has no sweetness scale on the back label, but the 11.5% alcohol suggests that it is off-dry, as it certainly tastes. It's a heavy, honey-soaked style, perhaps due to grapes that were affected by botrytis. Apple juice and honey flavors are right in the heart of this wine, which would pair well with a simple dessert of fresh fruit.",86
,Barraco 2010 Zibibbo (Sicilia),"Zibibbo is usually presented as a passito dessert wine, but this is dry. The natural floral fragrance of the variety emerges on the nose, while the mouthfeel and the honey and peach flavors are detailed with acids.",86

Roger Voss,Château Bois Noir 2009  Bordeaux Supérieur,"New wood dominates this soft wine. The fruit is round and smoky, featuring notes of black cherries and red plums that fall behind a toasty caramel sweetness. It needs several months for the wood influence to integrate.",86
Roger Voss,Château du Moulin Rouge 2010  Haut-Médoc,"Spicy, creamy new-wood aromas introduce a wine that is heavily dominated by woody tannins. The wine is very dry, its fruit a mere whisper in the background. Give this five years and the fruit may come forward, though that's not a guarantee.",86
Roger Voss,Chateau le Grand Verdus 2011 Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé),"An attractively fragrant rosé, this is very crisp and clean. It has lively raspberry and red currant flavors that are lightly touched by a herb note. A bright finish completes this refreshing wine.",86
,Dark Hundred 2011 Red (California),"Strong in black currant, raisin, blackberry pie and oaky flavors, this full-bodied effort has thick tannins. It's pleasant for drinking now with barbecue and roasts.",86
Paul Gregutt,Flying Trout 2010 Cutthroat Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This mix of 62% Pepper Bridge Vineyard Syrah and 38% Klipsun Vineyard Malbec has not entirely come together. The grapey fruit flavors and slightly stemmy tannins may ultimately complement each other, but that will require more bottle age. For the moment, give it a good decanting, or wait a couple more years before opening.",86
Roger Voss,Horeau-Beylot 2009 Château Grand Martinet  (Saint-Émilion),"Dry and firm, this is smothered with hard-edged tannins that give the wine a tough character. It will soften a little bit, but not completely.",86
Michael Schachner,Bodegas Artazu 2008 Santa Cruz de Artazu Garnacha (Navarra),"This Navarran Garnacha is more interesting, offering lemony, floral aromas that are red in nature and not very stout.

Michael Schachner,Burgo Viejo 2011 Tinto  (Rioja),"This Rioja opens with a jumpy, lively, candied red-fruit aroma. It feels solid, rubbery and stout, with dark fruit flavors that are accented by mild resin and butter notes. Feels a little sticky on the finish, with firm tannins.",86

Virginie Boone,Penumbra 2010 Petite Sirah (North Coast),"It's hard to get around the tannins that battle in this wine, which is savory and dark with a smoky aura. Lay it down another couple of years or let it air out a bit before pouring.",86
,Stemmari 2011 Grillo (Sicilia),"Using fruit that was sourced from the vineyards of Feudo Arancio near the town of Sambuca in southern Sicily, this pretty white wine offers bright aromas of lemon, green apple and cut grass. A long list of seafood menu items would pair with this Grillo.",86
,Tablas Creek 2011 Côtes de Tablas Blanc White (Paso Robles),"A blend of Viognier, Grenache Blanc, Marasanne and Roussanne, this is very generous, offering orange, pear, honeysuckle and vanilla flavors. However, the oak seems a little heavy-handed.",86
,Torre Quarto 2009 Sangue Blu Negroamaro (Puglia),"“Sangue Blu,” which translates to “blue blood,” offers sun-drenched aromas of ripe fruit and rum cake that are backed by tobacco and sweet Indian spice notes. The mouthfeel is textured, gritty and rich.",86

Joe Czerwinski,Saint André de Figuière 2007 Magali Rosé (Côtes de Provence),"There's a slightly confected top-note of cotton candy or bubble gum to this wine, but also decent concentration of canteloupe and peach fruit aromas and flavors. It's plump and medium-bodied, with a touch of refreshing minerality on the finish.",87
Michael Schachner,Santa Alicia 2006 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),Lavender and licorice on the nose; the palate mixes shy black cherry and cassis flavors with a bit of Chile's patented leafy character. The finish is round and offers a touch of vanilla and mocha. For the money this is solid and very easy to drink.,87
Roger Voss,Château d'Esclans 2006 Rosé (Côtes de Provence),"This is smoky and minerally upfront, influenced by barrel notes, but there's also some intense strawberry and raspberry fruit on the palate and a minerally reprise on the concentrated finish.",87
,Gainey 2006 Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),"A nice, dry Chard, a bit on the earthy, tobaccoey side, with pleasantly acidic mineral flavors and hints of lemons, limes and pineapples.",87
,Banear 2006 Mamàn White (Delle Venezie),"A luminous Italian white wine offersing subdued tones of stone fruit, white mineral and honey. There's an aromatic component that is reminiscent of mint and the wine is clean and easy in the mouth with a vibrant, fresh finish.",86
,Bonterra 2007 Rosé (Mendocino County),"Bonterra's first rosé, showing the clean purity and balance that nearly always characterize its wines. Bone dry and vibrant in acidity, this Sangiovese, Zinfandel and Grenache blend has tart cherry, raspberry, tea and vanilla flavors. You might want to open it early to let some sulfur blow off.",86
Susan Kostrzewa,Chaddsford 2005 Syrah (Pennsylvania),"Intriguing all around, this displays earthy notes of truffle and meat on the nose, and balanced flavors of full raspberry and spicy caramel on the palate. Though a touch angular, the wine has elegance and good fruit.",86
,Di Lenardo 2007 Vigneto Vigne dai Vieris Pinot Bianco (Venezia Giulia),"This is a very fragrant and pungent Pinot Bianco with aromas of exotic fruit, pineapple, apricot and melon. It represents a lighter, fresher take on the robust grape and delivers a medium, compact structure in the mouth.",86
,Lava Cap 2005 Reserve Zinfandel (El Dorado),"This mountain-grown Zin is dry, lusty, robust and briary, with peppery flavors of wild forest berries, leather and cola. You'll find firm acids, but the wine has a silky texture that's almost like Pinot Noir.",86
,Lavender Ridge 2006 Mourvèdre (Sierra Foothills),"Made in a soft, gentle way, this pretty Mourvèdre has chocolate-infused blackberry, currant, raspberry, licorice, cola and pepper flavors. It's very dry, and will drink well with a char-broiled steak.",86
Joe Czerwinski,Mas de la Dame 2007 Rosé du Mas Rosé (Les Baux de Provence),"Slightly confected on the nose, showing cotton candy and bubble gum aromas, but you'll also find plenty of strawberry-raspberry flavors. Very fruity and clean, with a fresh finish.",86
,Montevina 2005 Terra d'Oro Syrah (Amador County),"More tannic, drier and more acidic than most fine coastal Syrahs, this one from the Sierra Foothills is marked by its firm structure.The black currant, licorice, beef jerky and tobacco flavors are complex. Best now.",86
Roger Voss,Quinta de Ventozelo 2007 Cister da Ribeira White (Douro),"Ripe, fruity wine with quince and pineapple flavors, layered through with apple skin tannins. It could do with six months aging, but it will certainly be ready to drink by the fall.",86
Paul Gregutt,Substance 2006 Cs Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This austere and lightly herbal Cabernet is balanced and varietal, but at first seems a bit dull, as if tasted through a screen. That said, it actually improved after 24 hours, with more presence to the tart red and black fruits. It's an elegant style that will probably show best with food.",86
Joe Czerwinski,Mas de la Dame 2003 La Stèle Rouge Syrah-Cabernet (Les Baux de Provence),"This is a robust, dense wine, showing the hot character of the vintage in its aromas and flavors of fruitcake and spice and slightly rough texture. It's a blend of 60% Syrah and 40% Cabernet, matured in one-third new oak.",86
,Stevenot 2007 Rosado Rosé (Sierra Foothills),"This is a blush wine made primarily from the Spanish variety, Tempranillo. It's fairly dark for a rosé and quite full-bodied in cherry jam, pepper and vanilla flavors, while a splash of Albariño adds needed acidity and the bright taste of citrus.",86
,Stonehouse 2006 Tumbas Vineyard Viognier (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),"A little sugary-sweet, but the acidity is so crisp and clean, it balances things out. The pineapple, papaya, peach jam, honeysuckle and vanilla flavors are really delicious.",86
Michael Schachner,TerraMater 2006 Vineyard Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon-Carmenère (Curicó Valley),"A good but awkward attempt at a bigger, more saturated, more serious wine. The nose tells you that it's ripe, but there's some reduction in there too. The palate is revved up and tannic with turbulence along the way. Spice, chocolate and heat all play a part on the berry-driven palate.",86
,Fenestra 2006 Silvaspoons Vineyard Verdelho (Lodi),"Verdelho is one of those new varieties imported from old Europe that's providing a badly needed shot in the arm for California, namely, the need for crisply acidic, dry whites. It's a zesty, refreshing wine, with lemon-honey, peach and vanilla flavors.",86
Kerin O’Keefe,Renato Keber 2012 Pinot Grigio (Collio),"This is richer than most Pinot Grigios. It opens with aromas of toast, yellow flower, vanilla and a balsamic note while the round, full-bodied palate offers baked yellow apple, candied lemon drop, nectarine zest and almond.

Anna Lee C. Iijima,S.A. Prüm 2014 Essence Riesling (Mosel),"Crisp, cutting lime and lemon lend verve to crisp green apple and pear flavors in this fruity, fresh Riesling. It's approachable and refreshing, slicked with subtle honey and spice tones. The finish is brisk and clean.",88
Paul Gregutt,Schmidt 2011 Malbec (Southern Oregon),"The high alcohol is a good indication of the ultraripe fruit flavors here. Raisins and cooked cherries dominate, set against a background of tart cherry-pie acids. The concentration is impressive, as is the purity of the fruit flavors.",88
Kerin O’Keefe,Tercic 2013 Ribolla Gialla (Collio),"This lively white opens with aromas of peach blossom, crushed stone and whiff of toasted nut while the linear palate shows yellow peach, lemon zest and vibrant acidity. A mineral note closes the finish.",88
Virginie Boone,August Truth 2013 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Light and clear in color, this wine veers into cool-climate, restrained territory in its well-defined lines of sage, dried herb and stemmy earth. Dry tannins give an oomph of power beneath traces of dried rose.",88
Lauren Buzzeo,Terre Brûlée 2014 Chenin Blanc (Swartland),"The nose of this Chenin is light and dainty, with soft scents of toast, orange blossom, pear and white peach that dance in the glass. The palate is a bit more assertive, showing ripe flavors of pear and peach purée alongside a pleasant citric lift that refreshes the finish. Drink now.",88
Lauren Buzzeo,Delaire Graff 2012 Chenin Blanc (Swartland),"An underlying richness and toasty character grounds the upfront aromas of citrus pith, green apple and pineapple core.

It's light and energetic on the palate, with tangy cranberry juice and a touch of licorice.",88
Matt Kettmann,Bernat 2014 Rosé of Nebbiolo (Santa Ynez Valley),"An uncommon source grape for pink wine, this Nebbiolo shows lemon juice and watermelon on the rather rich and inviting nose. The palate's grippy texture packs flavors of strawberry fruit and lime zest, with acidic energy that would make a perfect pairing for fried chicken or heartier fish.",88
Michael Schachner,Bodega Norton 2013 Reserva Malbec (Mendoza),"This screaming violet-colored chunkster is big and blocky up front, with aromas of vitamins and grapy black fruits. A giant palate holds big tannins, while heady flavors of black plum and oak spice finish minty, toasty and with power.",88
Virginie Boone,Bouchaine 2013 Bacchus Collection Estate Vineyard Pinot Meunier (Carneros),"Rare to find on its own, as it's mainly used in sparkling-wine blends, this Pinot Meunier is earthy in dark truffle and herb, more savory, dry flavors that are wrapped in tightly woven tannins and oak. The muted fruit that's there recalls sweet raspberry.",88
Alexander Peartree,Brys 2012 Estate Grown Cabernet Franc (Old Mission Peninsula),"Dark-berry aromas meet hints of menthol and game on the nose. The medium-bodied palate follows suit on entry, but becomes lighter by the midpalate from a slick of minerality. Pair alongside gamy meats such as grilled venison loin.",88

Roger Voss,Casa da Passarella 2012 Somontes Colheita Red (Dão),"This is a fruity, juicy wine that has a dry tanninc core. That gives a mineral texture to the otherwise ripe and fruity wine. Full of black currant fruit flavors, shot through with acidity, the wine is ready to drink.",88
Alexander Peartree,Chateau Grand Traverse 2012 Reserve Cabernet Franc (Old Mission Peninsula),"With 26 months in small oak barrels, aromas of coconut cream, finely ground sawdust and cherry stems ride over condensed black cherry and currant.

Kerin O’Keefe,Nals Margreid 2014 Kerner (Alto Adige),"Grapefruit, peach and nectarine aromas carry over to the racy palate along with apricot. Zesty acidity provides refreshing balance and a tangy finish.",88
Kerin O’Keefe,Nals Margreid 2014 Sauvignon (Alto Adige),"This linear wine opens with aromas that suggest tomato vine, white spring flower and yellow grapefruit that carry over to the crisp palate along with a hint of zesty lemon peel. Racy acidity adds even more verve.",88

Anna Lee C. Iijima,Peter Mertes 2014 Platinum Riesling (Mosel),"Aromas of pressed apples and pears turn fleshier and riper on the palate of this forward, concentrated Riesling.

Roger Voss,Quinta do Vallado 2013 Sousão (Douro),"The dark color and high acidity of this wine are both typical of the Sousão grape which is normally found only in Douro blends. It is ripe, fruity and juicy although with tight acidity and black currant fruits. The wine's tannins suggest it needs to age, so drink from 2017.",88
Roger Voss,Quinta dos Murças NV 10 Anos Old Tawny  (Port),"The balance between wood aging and fruit is at its best in this wine. It shows plenty of red fruits filled out with raisins and nutmeg. As a contrast the wood aging has brought out a spicy, almond character. It is fresh, on the dry side for an aged tawny and, of course, ready to drink.",88
Jim Gordon,Replica 2014 Pinot Noir (California),"While big and brawny in style, this Pinot still maintains good balance. The aromas resemble toasty, spicy oak, with cranberry and dark cherry notes. The flavors echo the nose and are vivid due to lively acidity and a firm layer of tannins.",88
Roger Voss,Domaine de l'Hermitage 2010 Red (Bandol),"Big, full bodied and concentrated, this is a ripe, rich wine. Ripe plum flavors are balanced with nervy acidity and dense tannins. This is a wine that will still need to age, so don't drink before 2017.",93
Roger Voss,Domaine Weinbach 2011 Cuvée Théo Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"This is a remarkably spicy wine that is also finely balanced. It's sophisticated as well as rich, with spice and lychee flavors lifted by a crisp edge of acidity. It's complex in texture and should age well. Drink from 2015.",93

Paul Gregutt,Dunham 2010 XVI Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The sixteenth edition of Dunham's benchmark Cabernet Sauvignon bears a strong scent of new oak—it's aged in 70% French and 30% American. The wood is dominant, which is not surprising in a wine built for long term aging. Given plenty of time to breathe, bright red fruits, citrusy acids and a lovely mix of toast, caramel and clove accents emerge.",93
Paul Gregutt,Tamarack Cellars 2009 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Reserve Red (Red Mountain),"Richly aromatic, on the strength of the nose alone this could pass for something from Napa's Rutherford Bench. The blue and purple fruit notes and dusty tannins all say California, but the laser-like definition, minerality and natural acidity prove it's Washington fruit all the way. Strikingly dense and complex, with decades of life ahead.",93
Paul Gregutt,Tamarack Cellars 2012 Viognier (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Sourced entirely from the Sagemoor vineyard, this richly endowed Viognier smothers the palate in a lush mix of fat, candied citrus and tropical fruits. Honeysuckle and orange pekoe tea flavors trickle into the lingering, lip-smacking finish.",93
Roger Voss,Trimbach 2007 Vendanges Tardives Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"Sweet and rich, this is a wine that combines honey with a touch of toast and smokiness. The mid palate is filled with apricot and fresh lemon flavors. There is a fine acidity on the finish that gives a delicious lift.",93
Anne Krebiehl MW,Krutzler 2011 Reserve Blaufränkisch (Burgenland),"Alluring white-pepper spice, with nuances of dried thyme and seductive cherry fruit, make this a compelling choice with more depth than force. This is subtle and velvety, quietly convincing and very long. Firm yet ripe tannins provide structure and ageability. This will be even more elegant with a few years of cellaring; drink 2016–2020.",93
,Marita's Vineyard 2007 SOMA Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"The 2005 and 2006 bottlings of this Cabernet were awesome. So is this 2007. At the age of more than six years, it's just beginning its long journey. It's still tannic, but with ripe, sweet tannins that frame gorgeous, deeply satisfying blueberry, black currant, mocha and cedar flavors. It drinks well now, and will develop further in the bottle over the next eight years.",93
Paul Gregutt,Pamplin 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Sourced principally from Klipsun, with smaller amounts from Champoux and Seven Hills, this tight, dark, richly-flavored wine has impeccable credentials. Black fruits, espresso and citrus—notably blood orange—mingle seamlessly, though it takes some hours to open up. The Red Mountain fruit contributes characteristic notes of iron ore and underlying minerality.",92
Anne Krebiehl MW,Prieler 2010 Blaufränkisch (Leithaberg),"Red cherry fruit, with edges of white pepper, plays charmingly on both the nose and palate. The svelte figure of the wine belies its depth: this has subtle, Burgundian virtues and earthy undertones that provoke stimulating conversation and thought. An ideal accompaniment for subtle, nuanced dishes or a really good book.",92
Roger Voss,Rieflé 2010 Steinert Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace),"This is a textured wine with ripe and perfumed fruitiness. Honeyed in style and medium-sweet on the palate, it's a complex, rich wine that's ready to drink now, but could also improve with age.",92
Roger Voss,Rieflé 2010 Zinnkoepflé Grand Cru Vendanges Tardives Pinot Gris (Alsace),"Richly sweet, this is a wine that has traded primary fruitiness with deliciously balanced honey flavor and lively citrus acidity. It's a wine that has richness, intense flavor and the ability to age further.",92
,Rocca 2010 Collinetta Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Coombsville),"Coming on the heels of the extraordinary 2009 vintage, this '10 is a worthy followup. It's bone dry, tannic and enormously complex, offering waves of blackberry, currant, cola, new oak and spice flavors. It's so good now, you may not want to cellar it, but try. It will begin to approach its peak after 2017.",92
Sean P. Sullivan,Buty 2010 Columbia Rediviva Phinny Hill Vineyard Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"The 85% of Cabernet Sauvignon is upfront, with Syrah providing an accent. It's tightly wound, with notes of dusty cherry, sautéed herbs and spices, and tart cranberries supported by chewy, firm tannins that need time in the cellar to come into their own. Best after 2017.",92
,Caldwell 2011 Silver Red (Napa Valley),"Caldwell managed to wrest plenty of blackberry and cherry fruit into this Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend, even though the vintage was a tough one. The wine, aged in 80% new French oak, is elaborate and opulent, but the tannins are strong, giving the palate a lockdown astringency. It should age well though and your window of drinking begins in 2019.",92
Paul Gregutt,Charles Smith 2012 Stoneridge Vineyard Viognier (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This brings bracing minerality into the forefront, in a terroir-driven wine with excellent penetration and depth. A fresh mix of citrus and stone, this elevates Viognier into the top echelons of Washington white wines.",92
Roger Voss,Château Paradis 2010 Terre des Anges Red (Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence),"Firm and tannic in structure, this is a wine for aging. Ripe, dark fruits add power and a density of texture. Drink from 2016.",92
Roger Voss,Château Salettes 2011 Red (Bandol),"Structured and firm, this is a tight wine with powerful, youthful acidity as well as a dense structure and dark tannins. It has weight as well, indicating a wine with excellent aging potential. Drink from 2016.",92
Lauren Buzzeo,Kanonkop 2008 Paul Sauer Red (Simonsberg-Stellenbosch),"A blend of 69% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Cabernet Franc and 9% Merlot, this is a dense and brooding wine, with dark notes of cassis, licorice, black plum, date and cigar-box spice on the nose and in the mouth. The palate is firmly structured, with medium tannins and balanced alcohol that lend the wine a crushed-velvet texture. Glimmers of charred oak and toasted spice linger long on the finish. Delicious now, but should develop more layer and nuance with time; drink through 2018.",92
Paul Gregutt,Walla Walla Vintners 2010 Bello Rosso Cabernet Sauvignon-Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The 2010 Bello Rosso sticks to the 50-50 Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon formula, with a full, round, ripe and balanced palate. Fruity and forward, with citrus-accented cherry fruit, it pulls together the strengths of both grapes, with taut acidity and firm tannins.",92
Paul Gregutt,Walla Walla Vintners 2010 Sagemoor Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This sources grapes from the oldest (1972) blocks at Sagemoor, yielding a deep, rich and intense wine saturated with black cherry, cassis, licorice and barrel flavors. It's perfectly balanced, drinking beautifully, and fit for cellaring over a decade or longer.",92
Roger Voss,Domaine de Val d'Arenc 2011 Red (Bandol),"Dense and structured, this is a wine with good potential. It has weight, concentrated tannins and ripe fruit, as well as a solid, full-bodied feel. The palate is marked with power, a fine mineral texture and great acidity on the finish. Drink from 2017.",92
Anne Krebiehl MW,Domäne Wachau 2012 Achleiten Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),"A hint of mossy undergrowth leads on the nose, while lovely notes of white-pepper dusted green and yellow pear unfold on the soft, rounded palate. Those looking for texture as well as flavor will not be disappointed. Those who have the patience to cellar this will be rewarded with complex, mature flavors and great concentration. Drink 2016–2020.",92
Paul Gregutt,Efeste 2010 Upright Klipsun Vineyard Merlot (Red Mountain),"This is the first vintage for Upright—100% Klipsun Vineyard and 100% varietal Merlot. Thick and syrupy, it's a full throttle wine, with deep flavors of berry, cherry and cassis. Red licorice lightly streaks through the back end, and the wine makes a smooth landing on a strip of Bourbon barrel notes.",92
,Ferrari-Carano 2008 PreVail Back Forty Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"Sourced from a vineyard high up in the Mayacamas, on the Sonoma County side, this wine is intense with mountain grown fruit. The palate is full of ripe black currants, mocha and plenty of toasty oak. The tannins, while soft and pliant, are penetrating. All indications are of a wine that wants time in the cellar. Drink from 2016 till well beyond.",92
Anne Krebiehl MW,Fritsch 2011 'P' Pinot Noir (Wagram-Donauland),"Very subtle but ultimately seductive wild cherry notes captivate on the nose, while the body is luscious, rounded, generous and inviting, without an ounce of fat. There are hints of clove and anise, a deep, mellow cherry core and haunting floral hints. Drink 2015–2020.",92
Anne Krebiehl MW,Judith Beck 2011 Pannobile Red (Burgenland),"Brooding flavors of dark cherry and pure cocoa initially play on the palate, but it slowly opens up to reveal a deceptive lightness. The body is sleek yet concentrated, with super-soft tannins. With haunting edges of cherries preserved in kirsch and bitter chocolate, this is an intriguing, elegant wine that's lovely now but will also age gracefully through 2019.",92
Matt Kettmann,Epoch Estate Wines 2013 Authenticity Red (Paso Robles),"Dark and thick in the glass, this blend of 82% Syrah and 18% Mourvèdre leads with black cherry syrup, smoked beef and dark chocolate aromas, which blossom as the wine opens. Rich and lavish on the palate, it has fine tannins that frame its blueberry, cassis and mocha flavors. It's firmly structured, with a lingering acidity.",94
Virginie Boone,Z. Alexander Brown 2013 Limited Release Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A partnership between the Delicato Family and country musician Zac Brown, this well-made wine shows a wealth of flavor and complexity, from dusty saddle and earth to black cherry and berry. Muscular and dense, it reveals plenty of underlying structure and grace, with a bright sprinkling of spicy pepper on the finish. Drink ideally between 2020 and 2023.",94
Roger Voss,Alain Brumont 2011 Château Bouscassé Red (Madiran),Bouscassé is the home of Alain Brumont who also owns Château Montus in Madiran. This powerful wine with its blend of Tannat with the two Cabernets (Franc and Sauvignon) is dense and packed with firm tannins. It is also equally full of generous black-plum fruits and considerable acidity. This is still young—it's a concentrated wine that needs to age further. Drink from 2019.,94
Roger Voss,Alex Gambal 2014 La Maltroie Premier Cru  (Chassagne-Montrachet),"Crisp and packed with lively lemon-like acidity, this wine shows both minerality and intense fruitiness. Textured and tight, it has hints of yellow fruit in the background that will blossom as the wine develops. Drink from 2021.",94
Roger Voss,Alves de Sousa 2013 Abandonado Red (Douro),"This deeply impressive blend of 20 different varieties comes from a vineyard at the top of the Gaivosa estate that was oddly ignored for many years. With black plum fruit, dense tannins and intense acidity, it's built for longterm aging. Drink from 2021.",94
Virginie Boone,Carlisle 2014 The Derivative White (Sonoma County),"2014 proves another banner year for this delightful blend of Sémillon from Monte Rosso Vineyard, Muscadelle from Pagani Ranch and Palomino and Muscadelle from Saitone Ranch. High-toned in tart, refreshing acidity, it offers hints of vanilla biscuit with its lime, apple and melon flavors, lingering in memory for days.",94
Joe Czerwinski,Château La Nerthe 2013 Cuvée des Cadettes Red (Châteauneuf-du-Pape),"Purists will no doubt object to this wine's fine patina of sophisticated, cedary oak, but there's plenty of high-quality fruit to back it up. Incorporating unusual proportions of 44% Grenache, 33% Mourvèdre and 23% Syrah, the fruit is ripe and lush, velvety-supple and medium to full in weight, without any sense of heaviness. Drink 2020–2030.",94
Roger Voss,David Duband 2014 Aux Thorey Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges),"From one of the highest premier cru vineyards comes a wine that has a cool edge, generous fruit and firm tannins. Those elements come together with black cherry flavors and a dry core, promising a serious future. Drink from 2023.",94
Roger Voss,David Duband 2014 Les Sentiers Premier Cru  (Chambolle-Musigny),"This wine manages to combine firm structure with the finely perfumed fruit associated with Chambolle-Musigny. It's rich, fruity, lifted by acidity and held together by solid tannins. Impressive and full bodied, it's a wine to age. Drink from 2024.",94
Kerin O’Keefe,Le Ragnaie 2012 Fornace  (Brunello di Montalcino),"Underbrush, truffle, crushed herb and ripe black-skinned fruit aromas slowly take shape along with a waft of new leather. The bold palate shows mature black cherry, licorice, clove and tobacco framed in big velvety tannins. This is already tempting but will be even better in a few years. Drink 2020–2027.",94
Roger Voss,Louis Jadot 2014 Clos des Ursules Premier Cru  (Beaune),"This dense and structured wine comes from a small walled vineyard within the larger Les Vignes Franches premier cru, partially owned by Louis Jadot. Robust tannins frame its rich, juicy black fruit, showing potential for long aging. Drink from 2024.",94
Kerin O’Keefe,Masi 2009 Campolongo di Torbe  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),"Baked plum, baking spice, blue flower and pipe tobacco meld together with earthy aromas of new leather and a whiff of underbrush on this impressive wine. The firmly structured palate offers dried black cherry, blackberry jam, dark chocolate and star anise. Firm velvety tannins envelope the palate. Drink 2019–2029.",94
Matt Kettmann,Epoch Estate Wines 2013 Ingenuity Red (Paso Robles),"The winery's characteristic dense style is immediately apparent in this blend of 54% Syrah, 21% Mourvèdre, 16% Grenache and 9% Petite Sirah. It offers black licorice, smoked meat, baked black cherry and graphite aromas, needing time to breathe before unleashing black coffee, elderberry jam, asphalt and charcoal flavors through tarry tannins. Drink 2018–2028.",94
Virginie Boone,Freemark Abbey 2013 Cabernet Bosché Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"From a 22-acre site in the middle of the appellation, this is an impressive wine, softened by the addition of 6% Merlot. It boasts crushed rock, black currant and licorice flavors, with an attractive sanguine note. Pencil shavings, black pepper and cigar accents are present throughout.",94
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Fritz Haag 2015 Brauneberg Juffer Sonnenuhr Trocken GG Riesling (Mosel),"Initial whiffs of smoke and struck flint fade into pretty pineapple and blossom on the nose of this full-bodied, dry Riesling. Mango and tangerine flavors are riper and heftier on the palate than in many of the Mosel's 2015 Grosses Gewächs wines, neatly balanced by racy acidity and a backbone of cool steel. It's delicious already, but likely to evolve well through the 2020s at least.",94
Roger Voss,Georges Vigouroux 2014 Château de Haute-Serre Cuvée Géron Dadine de Haute-Serre Malbec (Cahors),"Named after the 15th century owner of this estate, the wine comes from a selection of the best parcels. With impressive tannins, a dense structure and rich bold black fruits, this is a powerful wine. It is full of ripe fruit with a mineral texture and has a good future. Drink from 2021.",94
Matt Kettmann,Grimm's Bluff 2014 Cliff Hanger Cabernet Sauvignon (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),"This wine from Rick Grimm and winemaker Paul Lato shows stunning potential for this new vineyard. Blackberry, thyme, black pepper and crushed slate aromas lead to a tremendously savory, umami-packed palate, where bay leaf and stewed mushroom notes envelop a core of blackberry and black currant fruit. The structure is solid, and the finish is long and strong.",94
Kerin O’Keefe,Foradori 2013 Morei Teroldego (Vigneti delle Dolomiti),"At first shy and brooding, this slowly opens up in the glass, offering aromas of black-skinned berry, blue flower, licorice and flint. The palate has concentration and finesse, boasting chewy black cherry, blackberry, chopped mint, anise and mineral alongside firm acidity and lithe tannins. Give this time to fully develop. Drink 2017–2023.",93
Virginie Boone,Joseph Phelps 2015 Estate Grown Sauvignon Blanc (St. Helena),"This is a standout, showing Napa Valley's true potential for the variety. Steely and light bodied in approach, it offers a lively complement of apricot and juicy green-apple flavors, finishing on a fresh fig note and feeling balanced and complete.",93
Kerin O’Keefe,Le Ragnaie 2012  Brunello di Montalcino,"Aromas of forest floor, baked plum, clove and a balsamic whiff of eucalyptus lead the nose. The firmly structured palate offers fleshy wild cherry, raspberry, star anise, tobacco and nutmeg alongside chewy tannins. Drink 2018–2024.",93
Roger Voss,Louis Jadot 2014 Les Boudots Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges),"This wine comes from a vineyard owned by the Gagey situated in the northern part of Nuits-Saint-Georges, close to Vosne-Romanée. It has firm structure and a perfumed character that is already enticing. Richly fruity with juicy acidity, it will be impressive as it ages. Drink from 2023.",93
Matt Kettmann,Mesa Del Sol 2011 Syrah (Arroyo Seco),"From a warm-climate zone in a cool vintage, this wine is fascinatingly savory. Black and white pepper, game meat, crushed graphite and espresso aromas promise an awesome sip. It delivers with black peppercorn, green olive, black plum skin and elderberry flavors.",93
Roger Voss,Mouchão 2012 Ponte das Canas Red (Alentejo),"From the historic Herdade do Mouchão in northern Alentejo, this is a powerful wine, full of dense tannins and impressively ripe, juicy black fruits. Syrah and Alicante Bouschet bring southern richness to Touriga Franca and Touriga Nacional. Drink this wine now.",93
Virginie Boone,Pine Ridge 2013 Fortis Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A top-of-the-line effort and a departure from the producer's single-vineyard, 100% varietal bottlings, this blends 4% Malbec and 3% Merlot. Spicy with clove scents, it showcases deep cassis and cranberry flavors, with a lift of red fruit and supportive acidity.",93
Matt Kettmann,Sandler 2015 Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Plump but sour cranberry fruit aromas meet with sweet sandalwood, clove and forest floor on the nose of this San Francisco-made bottling from the historic property. Sanguine touches on the palate lead to raspberry, cherry, cinnamon and juniper flavors, ending in a menthol finish.",93
Virginie Boone,Sixteen by Twenty 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"The partner label of Black Cordon, also made by consulting winemaker Paul Hobbs, this entry-level offering blends small amounts of all the red Bordeaux varieties and ages in 80% new French oak. Tar and graphite scents and bold, soft acidity support juicy black and red berry flavors, with a shock of anise. Best enjoyed 2023 through 2033.",93
Virginie Boone,Stone The Crows 2014 Three Twins Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),"From an estate vineyard, this impressive wine is earthy with tobacco leaf and juicy cherry and cassis notes. Soft, supple and lengthy, it lingers on the palate as a well-integrated, balanced and beautifully crafted expression of the grape.",93
Matt Kettmann,Tolosa 2015 Hollister Edna Ranch Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),"Extremely luscious on the nose, this bottling is redolent of baked black cherries, vanilla, smoke and wet riverstones. That fruit-forward style carries over to the palate, with cherry pie and baking spice flavors, backed by a solid and an expertly balanced acidity that holds those rich flavors in check.",93
Kerin O’Keefe,Villa Poggio Salvi 2011 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),"Mature plum, ripe berry, baking spice, underbrush and a balsamic note are some of the aromas you'll find on this full-bodied wine. On the chewy palate, notes of cinnamon, clove and licorice add depth to dried cherry and raspberry. Velvety tannins give it just enough tension and texture. Drink 2018–2024.",93
Virginie Boone,Volker Eisele Family Estate 2013 Sievers Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This varietal Cabernet Sauvignon hails from the producer's organic Chiles Valley estate. It's muscular and lushly layered, with spicy leather and tobacco notes accented by a delicate touch of violet and supported by firm, grippy tannin. Drink now through 2033.",93
Michael Schachner,TerraNoble 2006 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley),"There's no shortage of heavily charred oak, and early on it may seem a bit mulchy and leathery. But as it knits together and the fruit rises, you'll see that there's a compact, serious wine laying in wait. Flavors of blackberry, licorice and herbs are authentic and powerful. Clacky tannins make food almost mandatory.",86
,Terre de Trinci 2003 Riserva  (Montefalco Rosso),"This blend of Sangiovese, Merlot and Sagrantino is a simple, fruit-forward wine with loads of red cherry, blueberry, cedar wood and exotic spice. It has a gritty, spicy mouthfeel and big, powerful tannins.",86
,Mosolo Gleni 2006 Pinot Grigio Pinot Grigio (Colli Orientali del Friuli),"Opens with a pretty shade of gold that denotes more sophisticated extraction and in fact that impression is carried through to the nose and mouth where the wine exhibits ripe fruity aromas, honey, almond skin, dried herbs and natural rubber. The mouthfeel is thin, but remains a step above the commercial Pinot Grigio that is so commonly available. The wine is packaged with a real vine clipping around the bottle neck.",86
Paul Gregutt,Arbor Crest 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This has light but sweet fruit flavor, leaning heavily toward strawberry and Bing cherry candy. The fruit is a bit mismatched to the tannins, which are thick and chewy, but with additional bottle age the middle may fill out somewhat. It's got a pretty, fruity entry and a substantial, slightly earthy finish; it's just that midpalate that falls a bit short.",86
Michael Schachner,Aresti 2005 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Rio Claro),"A solid wine with a good mix of herbal, cola and red-fruit aromas. It deals spanking red fruit flavors and a sprinkle of vanilla and chocolate on the racy finish. For a short, fresh and clean wine, Aresti's Cab makes the grade.",86
Joe Czerwinski,Wolf Blass 2005 Yellow Label Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon (South Australia),"This 60-40 blend features gentle aromas of vanilla and cassis in a medium-bodied, creamy-smooth format. It's not powerful or complex, but offers pure cassis and vanilla flavors tinged with chocolate on the finish. Good value.",85
Michael Schachner,Chilensis 2006 Reserva Syrah (Maule Valley),"Big, bold, wild and dark, with mild burnt aromas backed by broad blackberry and plum flavors. This represents the fruity, thick style of Syrah, with additional notes of black olive and savory meat pie. It's not flawless but its pounding fruit character will earn its share of fans.",85
Michael Schachner,Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite) 2007 Los Vascos Chardonnay (Colchagua Valley),"Pungent and sharp, and that's exactly the style that Los Vascos has mastered in recent years. This wine tastes very much like a coastal, Casablanca Chardonnay yet it hails from Colchagua. The nose is pithy and citric, and the palate is more of the same. Good mouthfeel and fresh, but green, citrusy and too much like Sauvignon Blanc.",85
,Fetzer 2006 Valley Oaks Riesling (California),"With quite a bit of residual sugar, this Riesling is sweet, but balanced with crisp acidity that makes it clean and zesty. The flavors are of peaches, apricots, candied ginger, honeysuckle and vanilla. Low alcohol makes it easy to drink.",85
Michael Schachner,Finca Sophenia 2006 Altosur Cabernet Sauvignon (Tupungato),"Rather sweet and medicinal; the wine comes into form on the palate, which is fairly bright and forward as it pushes raspberry and cherry flavors. Acidity is on the high side, so the feel and finish have some burn. Could use some pizza or meat to help it along.",85
Roger Voss,Fournier Père et Fils 2006 Fournier  (Menetou-Salon),"A light wine, somewhat unfocused and lacking fruit intensity. But it is certainly pleasant, clean and fresh, with a definite green tinge and a citrus aftertaste.",85
Joe Czerwinski,Barker's Marque 2007 Arona Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"Shows plenty of weight on the palate, but also an overall lack of intensity to its slightly vegetal—green pea—flavors. Still, there's enough passion fruit and grapefruit to provide a sense of balance and a crisp, clean finish.",85
,Beringer 2004 Bancroft Ranch Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley),"The vineyard is on Howell Mountain. It's an awkward wine, with lots to like, but some problems. On the plus side is enormous  cassis, cherry and chocolate fruit flavor and rich, fine tannins, and the 100% new oak seems proper given the wine's volume. But there's too much sugary sweetness in the finish, almost like a dessert wine.",85
Susan Kostrzewa,Bock 2000 Cuvée Barrique Red (Villány),"The rich, spicy and savory nose evoke the food for which the country is known, and this wine would undoubtedly pair well with full-bodied, spiced meats and stews. Its full, spicy nose leads into dependable flavors of red berry, wooded spice and pepper, with a slightly bitter, smoked edge. Not a terribly complex wine, but solid and tasty nonetheless.",85
,Carneros Creek 2006 Reserve Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Shows a beautiful Pinotesque mouthfeel, all silk and satin, with that elegant Carneros acidity. But the flavors could be more concentrated. The cherries, cola and pomegranates feel a little watered down.",85
,Casale Triocco 2003  Sagrantino di Montefalco,"This is a bold and powerful wine with distinctive green notes that recall dried grass, black pepper and spice. It also has bitter chocolate, cardamom and cumin and its tannins are so strong, they literally leave your palate parched and dry.",85
,Castello di Monastero 2004 Sangiovese (Toscana),"Here's a delicate, feminine Sangiovese with a thin consistency and mature aromas of forest berry, raspberry, black olive and spice. It's a bit thorny in places with sour notes on the finish but it would pair well with pasta or pizza.",85
Joe Czerwinski,Konrad 2006 Pinot Noir (Marlborough),"Offers herb, cranberry and cherry aromas upfront, followed by a medium-bodied palate that's cedary and herbal, but also shows some chunky cherry fruit. Finishes on oaky notes of coffee and chocolate.",85
,Lungarotti 2006 Pinot Grigio Pinot Grigio (Umbria),"Here's a lean, almost colorless, citrus-driven Grigio from sunny Umbria that has a bit of candy and cola on its sweet, fragrant nose. There are peppermint renderings and dried hay in the background. It's watery and lean in the mouth and would pair with appetizers or simple vegetable dishes.",85
Joe Czerwinski,Mana 2006 Pinot Noir (Marlborough),"A soft, easy-to-drink Pinot Noir—even for Marlborough. Tannins are developed and supple, while the flavors lean toward caramel, cherry and sandalwood. Drink now.",85
Michael Schachner,Michel Torino 2007 Coleccion Chardonnay (Calchaquí Valley),"Light, floral and somewhat out of the mold. Flavors of apricot, peach and mango are both fresh and fleshy, while the finish lingers for quite some time. Fairly forceful but restrained enough.",85
,Robert Hall 2005 Vintage Port Port (Paso Robles),"Made from authentic Port varieties, this dessert wine is quite sweet. The residual sugar is about 9.5%, giving a honeyed finish to the blackberry and chocolate flavors. It doesn't have the complexity for aging, so drink now.",85
,Rubissow 2004 Trompettes Red (Mount Veeder),"A blend of Cabernet Franc and Merlot, with a splash of Cabernet Sauvignon, this tannic, dry wine has flavors of cherries, vanilla and smoky oak. It may develop some additional complexities over time.",85
Michael Schachner,Santa Julia 2007 Organica Chardonnay (Mendoza),"Round, nutty and smooth, with melon, citrus and apple flavors. In this wine's case, organic does not equal complexity. That said, what's here is clean and balanced, and there's more than enough fruit and intensity to satisfy.",85
Michael Schachner,Santa Julia 2007 Pinot Grigio (Mendoza),"Timing is everything with this full-bodied PG. Get at it right away and it will still be almost viscous, but it should also show ripe tropical fruit flavors, core acidity and lots of personality. Just don't let it hang around for long, especially not at room temperature.",85
,Ronco Blanchis 2006 Pinot Grigio (Collio),"This Pinot Grigio is a bit more fragrant and floral in essence with aromas of stone fruit and peach blossom. It has a fresh, almost piquant edge but it also has that characteristic watery mouthfeel you'll likely encounter with this variety.",85
Michael Schachner,San Pedro 2006 Castillo de Molina Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Cachapoal Valley),"The oak on this wine gives it a strong resin and cinnamon character. Along the way there's floral berry aromas, cherry and plum flavors, and finishing notes of root beer, chocolate and cough drops. A bit woody and tannic but it gets the job done.",85
,Planeta 2011 Cometa Fiano (Sicilia),"Among the greatest expressions of Fiano, Cometa is a full and generous effort, with deep layers of passion fruit and stone fruit, plus touches of vanilla, honey and light spice. The concentration and freshness is wonderful, and the wine would pair well with steamed lobsters or buttery crab legs.",92
,Sequana 2010 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Lush and opulent, this shows complex flavors of cherry compote, raspberry jam, date and exotic spice. Thoroughly dry on the finish, this drinks well right now. It offers a delicacy that's sometimes missing in Santa Lucia Pinot Noirs. From Hess Collection.",92
,Small Vines 2010 Baranoff Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Really easy to like now for its silky approachability, and for the way the flavors gather upfront and through the long, spicy finish. Polished and crisp, it has flavors of raspberries, cherries, tart cranberries and ripe pomegranates. The fruit is sourced from the cool, southern part of the Russian River Valley.",92
,Tasca d'Almerita 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sicilia),"Despite the problematic vintage, this wine opens with bold aromatic intensity, featuring notes of prune, plum, blackberry and spice. On the palate, the wine is structured and firm, with a touch of sweet cherry on the finish.",92
Paul Gregutt,Bergström 2010 Temperance Hill Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"The pretty fragrance comes with cotton candy highlights, along with a note of tangy red fruit. It's concentrated and deep, with appealing purity of flavor and the structure to age for over a decade.",92
Roger Voss,Bründlmayer 2011 Steinmassel Erste Lage Riesling (Kamptal),"Made using fruit from one of the top Kamptal vineyards, this perfumed wine has great texture, with tight acidity and notes of green plum skin and lemon zest. With its depth of flavor and nervy, minerally edge, it will age for at least four years.",92
Roger Voss,Château d'Aydie 2010 Madiran Laplace Tannat (Madiran),"A rich, full-bodied wine from one of the masters of Tannat, Pierre Laplace, this has ripe tannins and layers of toast, black plum and berry, with intense acidity on the finish.",92
Roger Voss,Château de Gaudou 2009 Réserve Caillou Malbec (Cahors),"Made using fruit sourced from a parcel of vines more than 60 years old, this is a dense, dark wine, with herb, dark fig and plum notes. Solid and concentrated, it has a firm texture, and the dusty tannins match well with the ripe fruit. Age for 7–8 years.",92
Roger Voss,Château des Jacques 2011 Clos de Rochegrès  (Moulin-à-Vent),"This is rich, spicy and full of red cherry flavor. It also has a dark, firm structure from the granite-based soil. The acidity that cuts through the fruit lends balance. Age this for 2–3 years.",92
Michael Schachner,Emiliana 2009 Gê Red (Colchagua Valley),"Gê is one of Chile's perennial best blends. It mixes Syrah, Carmenère and Cabernet Sauvignon into a lovable, complex whole. The nose is spicy yet suave, with cool berry, herb and olive aromas. It feels fresh, full and clean, with olive, pepper, cherry, cassis, coffee and chocolate flavors on the palate and finish. Only 452 cases made; drink now–2017.",92
,Happy Canyon Vineyard 2007 Barrack Brand Merlot (Santa Ynez Valley),"Made from Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc grown in the warm Happy Canyon region of the valley, this shows the greatness of the 2007 vintage. It's ready to drink, bearing soft, gentle tannins that frame flavors of blackberry and cherry jam, chocolate, vanilla and sweet, smoky oak.",92
,Palari 2009  Faro,"Loaded with personality and special distinguishing qualities, this blend of Nocera, Nerello Mascalese and Nerello Cappuccio is a wine for those interested in Italy's indigenous grapes.

Roger Voss,Pascal Aufranc 2011 Vignes de 1939  (Chénas),"Made using fruit that was sourced from vines planted in 1939, this wine shows the great concentration low yields and old vines can give. It has Gamay's natural freshness, with firm, dry tannins, a spice note and a fragrant finish. It's drinkable now, but it will be better in two years.",92
,Planeta 2010 Chardonnay (Sicilia),"Creamy, smooth and rich, this gorgeous bottling offers flavors of lemon mousse, apricot and vanilla, backed by well-integrated acidity and fruity concentration.",92
Paul Gregutt,Carabella 2010 Inchinnan Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"The mysteriously named Inchinnan offers a flavorful mix of mint, berry, cherry, milk chocolate, Asian spice, cedar and cola. It's harmonious, with subtle power and excellent length.",92
,Charles Krug 2009 Vintage Selection Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Vintage Selection has long been the winery's age-worthy 100% Cabernet. Although this has an alcohol content that's higher than in the past, it should still reward cellaring. The wine is rich with a sweet blackberry flavor, with lots of new French oak. The tannins are hard, reminiscent of an older era of Napa Cabernet. Give it 5–6 years, but anything longer than that and the fruit may be threatened.",92
Roger Voss,Château Blaignan 2010  Médoc,"Aromatic hints of new wood translate onto the smooth palate. It has smoke and black currant flavors, with tannins that are already well integrated. Attractive acidity gives this a final lift. Keep it for 5–6 years.",92
Roger Voss,Château d'Aydie 2009 Tannat (Madiran),"A new-wood-dominated wine, this has a heavy toast character, with extracted licorice and dark chocolate flavors as well as a big black-plum note. Rich and weighty, with juicy acidity, this demands many years of aging.",92
Roger Voss,Château de Gaudou 2010 Renaissance Malbec (Cahors),"A powerful, wood-aged wine, this shows weighty black fruit and a toasty character. It is concentrated and solid, yet it has a soft and rich side as well.  The tarry, tannic character needs at least four years to soften.",92
Michael Schachner,Concha y Toro 2009 Terrunyo Vineyard Selection Block Las Terrazas Unfiltered Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),"The nose is an attractive mix of cassis and mineral notes. The palate is more racy and wiry than dense and soft, with juicy, flashy flavors of berry, cherry and currant. Those notes all carry through to the long finish; drink from 2013–2018.",92
Roger Voss,Domaine Bru-Baché 2008 La Quintessence  (Jurançon),"One of a pair of gorgeous Petit Manseng-based dessert wines by Claude Loustalot, this has richness but also lightness from the fresh acidity. This is fruity and fragrant, with a peach-like crispness, and it's worth keeping for another 3–4 years.",92
Michael Schachner,Lagar de Bezana 2010 Aluvion Gran Reserva Ensamblaje Red (Cachapoal Valley),"Aromas of lead pencil, cassis, violet petal and smoky chocolate are complex and attractive. The palate of this Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend is tight, pure and rich, and the flavors of toasty black fruits carry accents of licorice and coffee. The finish is spicy, with a licorice note, and the wine's tannic composition suggests that aging is appropriate. Drink from 2014–2020.",92
,Morgante 2009 Don Antonio Nero d'Avola (Sicilia),"Rich and full, this has aromas of cherry, toasted nut, spice and chocolate. Its persistency would pair with roast pork stuffed with prunes.",92
Paul Gregutt,Rex Hill 2010 Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"A huge step up from the previous vintage, this ripe, round and wonderfully fruity effort is a juicy, mineral-soaked bottle of joy. Luscious cherry fruit is topped with a dollop of butterscotch.",92
Michael Schachner,Santa Carolina 2009 VSC Red (Cachapoal Valley),"There's a lot to like about this dense, deep, lush and totally ripe blend of 60% Petit Verdot plus smaller doses of Cabernet, Carmenère, Malbec and Mourvèdre. It glistens in the glass and shows plush aromatics and generous flavors of berry, plum, chocolate and spice. Toasty and smooth on the finish. Drink this excellent blend now–2018.",92
Virginie Boone,Steven Kent 2009 The Premier Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley),"A new addition to Steven Kent's lineup of exemplary Cabernets, this is 100% Cabernet from Ghielmetti Vineyard, one of Kent's favorite pieces of Livermore ground. The wine is concentrated and rich, with heady notes of dark cherry, cinnamon and clove, plus a trace of mint hiding in the background. This will please fans of California and Bordeaux wines.",92
Kerin O’Keefe,Hauner 2015 Hierà Rosé (Terre Siciliane),"Aromas of acacia, mature apple, hazelnut and an unusual balsamic note lead the nose. The palate is already evolved and has lost most of its fruit richness and freshness, offering instead honeyed mineral, toasted nut and a hint of dried citrus peel.",86
Roger Voss,Herdade do Esporão 2016 Defesa Branco White (Alentejano),There is an attractive spiciness to this clean warm wine. White currants and acidity add to the approachability of a wine that is ready to drink.,86
Roger Voss,J. Portugal Ramos 2016 Pouca Roupa Rosé (Alentejano),This is a really refreshing style of rosé. Its fruity raspberry and red-currant flavors are shot through with fine acidity and a lively crisp aftertaste. Drink this attractive wine now.,86
Jim Gordon,Jack's House 2015 Chardonnay (California),"This solid, well-made wine has pleasant apple and pear flavors, light herbal accents, medium body and a smooth texture.",86
Michael Schachner,Jean León 2015 3055 Chardonnay (Penedès),"This wine's melon and mango aromas come with an oily note of lanolin. It feels lazy on the palate, with just enough acidity to maintain freshness. Mild tropical fruit flavors turn yeasty on its hollow finish. Drink immediately.",86
Michael Schachner,Bodegas Luzón 2014 Luzón Red (Jumilla),"Cherry and blackberry aromas come with spice and cool note of cola in this Monatrell-Syrah blend. It's narrow and tannic, with black fruit and desert herb flavors that finish dry and rubbery.",86
Michael Schachner,Volver 2014 Single Vineyard Tempranillo (La Mancha),"This wine's charred nose suggests over-the-top oak. The palate is a rough road of hard grape skin tannins. Char and clove flavors blanket its savory, meaty berry fruit, finishing woody and redolent of clove.",85
Jim Gordon,Cellars 33 2016 Rosé (California),"This wine's light, sugary, red cherry and watermelon aromas lead to similar flavors and a light, lean texture. It has a bright coral color that's eye-catching.",85
Roger Voss,Château de Chaintres 2013 Clos des Oratoriens  (Saumur),"This wood aged Chenin Blanc has a strongly oxidative character. It has lost its fruit in favor of grilled almonds, toast and intense acidity. Drink this mature wine now.",85
Roger Voss,Château de la Vieille Tour 2016  Bordeaux Blanc,"In the Boissonneau family since 1839, this southern Entre-Deux-Mers vineyard gives a crisp, herbal wine with light fruit and attractive acidity. It has lemon and grapefruit flavors, bright with a crisp aftertaste. Drink now.",85
Roger Voss,Château la France 2016  Bordeaux Blanc,"The Mottet family bought this chateau in 2009 and has been in renovation mode: chateau, winery, vast vineyards and placement of a dramatic 40-foot steel rooster in the vineyard. This wine is refreshing, lively and crisp, with plenty of acidity. It reveals spice, apples and lime flavors along with a more mineral side. The wine is ready to drink.",85
Roger Voss,Château Lalande Méric 2016 Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé),This wine has a touch of caramel as well as spice. Both work well with the red fruits that shine through this ripe wine. It is ready to drink.,85

Virginie Boone,Cline 2015 Syrah (Sonoma County),Barrel toast and smoky gunpowder scents give this wine a savory edginess before revealing medium-bodied layers of baked blackberry and cherry.,85
Michael Schachner,Clos de Nit 2015 Red (Montsant),"The tomato and plum aromas in this Garnacha blend are a bit soupy. Its chunky palate is heavy with generic berry fruit and a touch of oxidation. A solid, middle-of-the-road pour.",85
Roger Voss,DFJ Vinhos 2016 Bigode Rosé (Lisboa),"This is a crisp, clean and refreshing wine. There is just the lightest sense of tannin giving the wine a zingy edge. Other than that, it is red-berry fruits all the way. Drink now.",85
Roger Voss,DFJ Vinhos 2016 Casa do Lago Branco White (Lisboa),"This is a delicious and ripe-fruited wine. Dominated by Fernão Pires, it has an apple-puree texture: smooth and creamy. The wine has an edge of light acidity at the end to give it a lift. Drink now.",85

Michael Schachner,Raventós de Alella 2015 Tina 20 Pansa Blanca (Alella),"This varietal Xarello feels more flat than vivid. It has fleshy yet generic white fruit aromas, ripe melon flavors and a tired finish.",85
Michael Schachner,Rubus 2016 Chardonnay (Colchagua Valley),"Melon, wood spice and vanilla aromas are common for this level of Chilean Chardonnay. A plump palate is low on acidity, while this tastes of pear, oak and skins-based bitterness. A woody tasting finish is adequate.",85
Roger Voss,Sanguinhal 2016 Cerejeiras Tinto Red (Lisboa),"This simple and fruity wine is made to be drunk young. And with its red fruits, light acidity and crisp texture, it succeeds. Drink the wine with summer barbecues.",85
Michael Schachner,Santa Rita 2016 120 Reserva Especial Carmenère (Central Valley),"Wiry currant and plum aromas show a touch of oak in this value-priced wine. It feels somewhat chunky on the palate, with scraping tannins. Herbal plum flavors finish gamy and with a mild note of oaky clove.",85
Michael Schachner,Valdivieso 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Central Valley),"Briny saltwater aromas dominate a mild mostly fruitless nose. This feels basic and round, with a lemony streak. Mild nectarine flavors don't amount to much, while this is simple and generic on the finish.",85
Kerin O’Keefe,Villa Cordevigo 2016 Heaven Scent  (Bardolino Chiaretto),"Subtly scented, this opens with aromas of citrus zest, spring flower and wild berry. It's fresh and informal, with light strawberry and sour-cherry flavors supported by fresh acidity.",85
Roger Voss,Wines & Winemakers 2016 Casa Ermelinda Freitas Monte da Baía Branco White (Península de Setúbal),"The blend of Fernão Pires and Arinto is a classic for the region.

Roger Voss,Adega Cooperativa de Borba 2016 Cuvée B Red (Alentejo),"This is an open and ready-to-drink wine that has soft tannins and juicy blackberry fruit. With 50% Aragonez in the blend, it is has a smooth character that brings out plenty fruit and not too much structure. Drink now.",85
Kerin O’Keefe,Botromagno 2016 Rosé di Lulu Rosato (Murgia),"Made with Nero di Troia grapes, this has aromas of wild rose, citrus peel and a whiff of Mediterranean brush. The bright informal palate offers sour cherry and strawberry accompanied by zesty acidity.",85

Paul Gregutt,Quilceda Creek 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The flagship wine from Quilceda Creek offers exotic scents of plum, cassis, loam, coffee and pine sap, a rich and evocative blend. The wine delivers all that is promised and more; it is deep and dense with flavor, polished, focused and persistent. Vanilla, espresso, fine tannins, luscious acids and cascading fruits.",99
,Williams Selyem 2009 Precious Mountain Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"A stupendous Pinot Noir, showing how beautifully this vineyard performs in the remote Sonoma Coast above Fort Ross. Williams Selyem's last few vintages of Precious Mountain have been extraordinary, but this 2009 tops them all. The wine is as light as a feather in the mouth, modest in alcohol and delicately feminine, like pure satin. However, few Pinot Noirs in the world achieve this level of concentration. Wild raspberries and cherries, cola, sleek minerals, dusty baking spices and smoky oak combine for flavors that are utterly delicious. After all that, it possesses an indefinable attribute of fascination. Will age well for a long time, if you can keep your hands off it. Now–2021.",99
Roger Voss,Château Margaux 2009  Margaux,"A massive wine for Margaux, packed with tannins and ripe fruit. It has more Cabernet Sauvignon than usual, giving intense black currant flavors with enticing acidity balanced by the sweetness of the fruit. Ripe swathes of this opulent fruit are also elegant and structured.",98
Roger Voss,Château Palmer 2009  Margaux,"A beautiful wine, with the firmest tannins surrounded by perfumed fruit. It is dense, of course, but this density is balanced with great elegance, blackberry fruits, sweetness and final juicy acidity. The wine is structured, a powerhouse of concentration while preserving this complete style.",98
Paul Gregutt,Pirouette 2008 Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A stunning Pirouette—63% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Merlot, 9% Cab Franc and 6% Petit Verdot. Full and magnificently rich, it is loaded with dense and thrilling fruit flavors of black cherry and cassis. A streak of iron and a hint of citrus keep the wine evolving through a long, beautifully balanced finish. Retasted after being open for 24 hours, the wine was as fresh and thrilling as on the first day.",98
,Marchesi Antinori 2008 Guado al Tasso  (Bolgheri Superiore),"Here's a “wow” wine on every level, with incredible intensity and supple softness that builds momentum over many long minutes. A sweet cherry note at the core is surrounded by lush layers of tobacco, dark chocolate and spice, which promise to evolve gracefully over years to come.",98
Roger Voss,Château Troplong Mondot 2009  Saint-Émilion,"A very concentrated wine with such a stylish feel. It balances ripe berry fruits with chocolate and wood flavors in the richest, ripest combination. The wine has power, without losing its poised character. It's ready for long aging.",97
,Tenuta San Guido 2008 Sassicaia  (Bolgheri Sassicaia),"Recently implemented winemaker and cellar changes make this one of the best Sassicaias ever. This Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc blend delivers thick concentration and sun-kissed aromas of black fruit, prune, dried bay leaf, black olive and tobacco. The thick, fertile soils that characterize the magical strip of coastal Tuscany at Bol-gheri help shape amazing richness and intensity.",97
,Tenuta dell'Ornellaia 2008 Ornellaia  (Bolgheri Superiore),"The 2008 Ornellaia delivers concentrated aromas of forest fruit, raspberry and black cherry. There are beautiful elements of soft spice and chocolate at the back and the wine ends with soft, plush tannins and smooth, berry-rich flavors.",97
,JCB 2009 No. 1 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"An outstanding wine, the best California Cabernet Jean-Charles Boisset has ever produced from any of his properties. It stands out in any tasting of its peers. Made from 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, and aged in 60% new oak, it shows satisfying, complex flavors of blackberries, blueberries, cassis, hazelnut-infused chocolate and spices. Hard to exaggerate its power and grace. Wonderful now and for a good six years, but it's difficult to predict its evolution beyond 2018.",97
Roger Voss,Château La Mission Haut-Brion 2009  Pessac-Léognan,"Such a generous and ripe wine, with a dark core of tannins surrounded by opulent fruit. Black fruits, coffee, very concentrated flavors, a powerhouse of structure and richness. The warmth of the wine is palpable, as is the aging potential.",97
,Williams Selyem 2009 Allen Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A drop-dead gorgeous Pinot Noir that will satisfy everyone from Burgundy fans to diehard Cabernet cultists. Show an elegant complexity and silky texture that define great California Pinot Noir, yet with a powerful impact that emphasizes raspberries, cherries and blueberries. Brilliant acidity and tannins provide the perfect framework on this wine that's drinkable now, and will develop over the next 15–20 years.",97
Roger Voss,Château Figeac 2009  Saint-Émilion,"A ripe year like 2009 is kind to the Cabernet Sauvignon of Château Figeac. The wine is perfumed with new wood and sweet fruits, delicious black currant flavors giving both ripeness and freshness. The wine has weight and impressive density. A star of the vintage.",96
Roger Voss,Château Léoville Poyferré 2009  Saint-Julien,"An immensely structured wine, packed with dark tannins promising aging potential. It is complex, powerful, layered with new wood and concentration, finishing with dark plum fruits and acidity.",96
,Tenuta Argentiera 2008 Argentiera  (Bolgheri Superiore),"Here's a beautifully chocolaty and rich blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, with plush layers of sweet cherry, Indian spice, tobacco and espresso. The wine is amazingly rich and long lasting, with silky, supple tannins at the very end. Keep it in your cellar 10 years or more, or drink it now.",96
Roger Voss,Château Haut-Brion 2009  Pessac-Léognan,"Solid, very structured, packed with dense and dry tannins. There is a core of acidity and darkness that gives the wine a brooding, powerful character. At this stage, it seems austere although it does have the weight of fruit typical of the year.",96
Roger Voss,Château la Fleur-Pétrus 2009  Pomerol,"Just across the road from Pétrus, la Fleur-Pétrus shares some of the same intensity. There is great fruit here, rounded and powerful with the ripest character. It is open, generous, ready to drink. The tannins lead into the purest acidity, letting the fruit sing.",96
Roger Voss,Château Lynch-Bages 2009  Pauillac,"A dense, immense, solidly powerful wine. The ripest fruit overflows, paralleling the dark, solid tannins. As so often, Lynch-Bages is a blockbuster, dark and concentrated, with immense aging potential.",96
,Groth 2008 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"A huge Cabernet, in the best sense of the word. It wasn't the easiest vintage, as 2007 was, but meticulous winemaking did the job, resulting in this amazingly rich, impressively ripe wine that's drinkable now and will develop for many years. The fruits veer toward blackberries, cherries and cola, and the tannins are soft and refined. One hundred percent new French oak isn't at all heavy, lending nuances of buttered toast and sweet wood tannins. Will easily age for 15 years.",96
Roger Voss,Château Mouton Rothschild 2009  Pauillac,"The purest Cabernet Sauvignon fruit, with dark chocolate and intense dark berry flavors. The tannins are so enveloped by the fruit and yet they promise great aging. At this stage, wood shows through the fruit, but the texture is so rich and opulent that it should easily become integrated.",96
Roger Voss,Château Trotanoy 2009  Pomerol,"Beneath the surface tannins is great Merlot fruit, very ripe and full-bodied, a powerhouse of flavors. The depth and complexity of the wine is all there, along with a dark core of dryness. A wine for long-term aging.",96
,Williams Selyem 2009 Rochioli Riverblock Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A triumph, one of the greatest Riverblock bottings in years. This always is a captivating wine, but the '09 is particularly scrumptious. Although it's quite tannic and acidic, it's forward enough in raspberries, cherries and cola to enjoy now. But it's bone dry and as elegant as California Pinot Noir gets. The balance suggests an ability to age for a good 10 years, if not longer.",96
Roger Voss,Château Beau-Séjour Bécot 2009  Saint-Émilion,"Minty new wood aromas on a wine that shows both great tannins and sweet wood. The fruit is still to show, but promises fresh plum flavors that will be delicious and juicy. This is a ripe, concentrated wine.",96
,Williams Selyem 2009 Flax Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A sip is all it takes to fall in love with this potent Pinot Noir. Big tannins and crisp acidity make it hard to appreciate now, but there's a gigantic core of cherries and raspberries, with a firm minerality from the soil. Will develop bottle complexity over the years. Don't even think of popping the cork before 2015.",95
Roger Voss,Château Branaire-Ducru 2009  Saint-Julien,"Very supple wine, with great richness and density. It is all so complete, a pleasure, powerful yet also with sweet opulent fruits layered with dark tannins. For long-term aging.",95
Roger Voss,Château Canon 2009  Saint-Émilion,"Hugely dense, foursquare wine with great fruit and the purest tannins. Chocolate and coffee predominate at the same time as sweet tannins and acidity. A wine that combines charm with great power.",95
Roger Voss,Château Canon la Gaffelière 2009  Saint-Émilion,"One of the peculiarities of St.-Émilion's classification is that Canon la Gaffelière is not classed in the top rung. Because, as this wine shows, it produces superb wines. This is ripe while so elegant, with great intensity and sweet perfumes.",95
Paul Gregutt,Doyenne 2008 Grand Ciel Vineyard Syrah (Red Mountain),"Certainly the finest Grand Ciel Syrah to date, this is a full-flavored, complete wine, loaded with pure fruit flavors of berry and cassis. The details pile on—a whiff of stone, a hint of chocolate, suggestions of spice, all in perfect proportion.",95
,Hanzell 2009 Chardonnay (Sonoma Valley),"A tremendous Chardonnay. As always, the winery's '09 is bone dry, crisply acidic and minerally. You might call it austere at this point, with its tart finish of grapefruit. But a great Hanzell Chardonnay will improve for at least a decade, possible two, and this is a great Hanzell Chardonnay. The score reflects what the wine likely will be approximately eight years down the road.",95
Virginie Boone,Balletto 2013 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"A blend of three vineyards, all estate, this is a sublime, viscous and somewhat briny wine that exhibits some oak on the nose. With a balance of weight and creaminess, it starts in ginger and nutmeg spiciness on the nose, building on the palate into fresh-cut apple and pear.",88
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Billsboro 2013 Sawmill Creek Vineyards Syrah (Finger Lakes),"Ripe, luscious black cherries and berries are framed by whispers of bramble and tannin in this enticingly fruity, forward Syrah. A showcase of fresh, primary fruit, it's juicy and delightfully gulp-worthy. Drink now through 2017.",88
Virginie Boone,C'est Bon 2013 Reserve Selection Chardonnay (Oakville),"Waxy apple and lemon pith open this wine, followed by crisp, candied grapefruit. Robust, it finishes dry and balanced. The whole sums up into a full-bodied, rich and lush experience.",88
Kerin O’Keefe,Ceuso 2014 Scurati Nero d'Avola (Terre Siciliane),"Aromas of mature black-skinned fruit, dark spice and game come together in the glass. On the palate, notes of ground pepper and anise accent a core of dried black cherry while dusty tannins give it a firm finish. Drink soon.",88
Roger Voss,Château Balac 2012 Cru Bourgeois  (Haut-Médoc),"This wine enjoys the fruitiness of the vintage with its black-currant flavors and light tannic structure. The blend is 50% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Cabernet Franc. The Cabernets, with ripe berry flavors that dominate here, give a firm core to the wine while not losing the potential of the fruit. Drink from 2017.",88
Roger Voss,Château des Annereaux 2011  Lalande de Pomerol,"Now managed organically, this estate has produced a light, fruity wine. Fresh red berries are sustained by a firm tannin edge that offers a solid base for the fruitiness and acidity. Drink from 2017.",88
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Château Frank NV Célèbre Crémant Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Gorgeous floral tones abound throughout this fruity, fresh, sparkling Riesling. It's a bit chewy and mouth-filling in foam, but pristine peach and apple flavors and spine-tingling acidity are enthralling.",88
Roger Voss,Château Haut-Bergey 2013  Pessac-Léognan,"This fresh wine has attractive citrus and yellow fruit flavors and an orange tang. It needs more time; drink from 2017. The property includes five acres of white grapes and 65 acres of red. Sylviane Garcin-Cathiard also owns Clos L'Église in Pomerol, Château Barde-Haut in Saint-Émilion and Château Branon in Pessac-Léognan.",88
Roger Voss,Château Larrivet Haut-Brion 2014 Les Hauts de Larrivet Haut-Brion  (Pessac-Léognan),"Herbal and fruity at this young stage, this wine is bright with acidity, citrus fruits and a tangy texture. It is still young and almost too crisp for its own good, although it will likely develop into an attractively fruity, ripe wine with a fine weight of flavor. Drink from 2017.",88
Roger Voss,Château le Sartre 2013  Pessac-Léognan,"Bright and fruity, this is classic white Bordeaux with its citrus and lively acidity as well as a crisp texture. It has weight and shows some potential to fill out, so drink from 2017. Because of spring frost and summer rain, Marie-José (Perrin) Leriche reduced the (90%) Sauvignon Blanc and (10%) Sémillion harvest by a third.",88
Roger Voss,Château Mancèdre 2013  Pessac-Léognan,This wine is dry but rich enough with black-currant flavors to compensate. The juicy aftertaste suggests the wine will develop quickly. Drink from 2017. This wine is the latest result of renovations on the 15-generation and 400-year-old Trocard family estate.,88
Roger Voss,Château Peyredon Lagravette 2013  Haut-Médoc,"This small 10-acre property has produced an attractively fruity wine with soft tannins and juicy black-fruit flavors. It is lightly structured—displaying more fruit than tannin—and has a fresh, bright aftertaste. Drink from 2017.",88
Roger Voss,Château Potensac 2013 Chapelle de Potensac  (Médoc),"This second wine of Château Potensac is soft, fruity with a hint of firmer structure. Juicy Cabernet gives the wine its shape and freshness. It is already drinkable, fruity and fresh.",88
Sean P. Sullivan,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2012 Indian Wells Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wine is equal parts Syrah and Merlot (43% each), with the balance a smattering of other varieties. The coffee and berry aromas seem faint while the palate delivers all of the plush fruit flavors this vintage has to offer.",88
Roger Voss,Clos Beauregard 2013  Pomerol,"This stylish Merlot-based wine has juicy red-berry flavors that are sustained by acidity and firmed up by tannins. Still dry from its dense structure, it's developing well. Drink from 2018.",88
Jim Gordon,Dark Horse 2014 The Original Pinot Noir (California),"Smoothness, complexity and a great price are the strong points of this medium-bodied wine. It has wonderful raspberry, cedar and red-cherry flavors, light tannins, a polished feel on the palate and lingering finish.",88
Jim Gordon,Domaine Anderson 2013 Walraven Vineyard Chardonnay (Anderson Valley),"Pure butterscotch aromas seem to leap from the glass, yet the flavors are dry and rather reserved, not nearly as obvious as the smell. The balance leans toward tartness, the flavors are lean and the finish lemony.",88
Sean P. Sullivan,Dowsett Family 2014 Aunt Diane's Vineyard Riesling (Columbia Gorge (WA)),"Perfumed aromas offer notes of white flowers, mineral and pink grapefruit. The flavors are dry and elegantly styled with a lingering finish. It will drink well at the dinner table.",88
Kerin O’Keefe,Feudo Antico 2010 Memorie Rosato (Sicilia),"Made with Nero d'Avola and aged in wood, this unusual rosato opens with aromas that recall mature red fruit, cake spice, chopped sage, oak and a balsamic note. The smooth, round palate offers candied red cherry, tangerine zest, toasted almond and a note of candied ginger alongside bright acidity. It has a tutti frutti finish but the overall array of flavors gives it some depth.",88
Sean P. Sullivan,Gamache 2012 Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Vanilla, licorice, herb and woodspice aromas are followed by slightly gritty-feeling cranberry flavors. This wine is interesting, but it doesn't all come together.",88
Joe Czerwinski,Mills Reef 2014 Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Hawke's Bay),"This medium-bodied wine is marked by dry, stony notes rather than a profusion of fruit. Subtle leafiness and hints of underripe melon give this a restrained aspect and suggest it's more of a food partner than a wine that will shine on its own.",87
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Paumanok 2014 Semi Dry Riesling (North Fork of Long Island),Ripe peach and yellow cherry aromas take a turn towards the tropics on the palate of this intensely fruity wine. It's semi-dry in style with a slightly candied tone but balanced neatly by tart lemon­-lime acidity. Drink now.,87
Virginie Boone,Broken Clouds 2014 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"This has value written all over it, offering fleshy, ripe tropical aromas and flavors. The personality is large and in charge, yet the wine itself remains reasonably balanced and firm in structure.",87
Sean P. Sullivan,Browne Family Vineyards 2014 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Vanilla, coconut and toast aromas are vibrant and out-front, followed by tropical fruit. This wine is full bodied with a viscous, almost oily feel that persists through the finish. It offers some good things, but the variety gets lost in the style.",87
Kerin O’Keefe,Caruso & Minini 2012 Cutaja Riserva Nero d'Avola (Delia Nivolelli),"Mature plum, aromatic herb and a whiff of cocoa lead the nose. The dense palate offers toasted oak, blackberry extract and espresso alongside fine-grained tannins that leave a firm, drying finish.",87
Sean P. Sullivan,Castillo De Feliciana 2014 Estate Vineyard Albariño (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"The aromas of flowers and freshly cut pear, melon and starfruit are bright and fresh. This wine is dry and thick in feel with abundant citrus-rind flavors. There's enjoyment to be had but it gets bogged down in the middle.",87
Roger Voss,Château Amour 2013  Médoc,"Under the same ownership as Château de Panigon, this property (which has a heart on its cork) has produced a wine offering layers of smoky wood as well as ripe fruit. That solid structure suggests the wine will need time to develop. The aftertaste boosts a more juicy fruitiness.",87
Roger Voss,Château de Cruzeau 2013  Pessac-Léognan,"This wine is still closed, lean and firm with its fruitiness masked by a strong mineral structure. It needs plenty of time to develop, so drink from 2018.",87
Roger Voss,Château de Paillet-Quancard 2012  Cadillac Côtes de Bordeaux,"Still lean and structured, this is a cool-feeling, young wine. It has dry tannins and a chewy texture that needs to soften. At the back, juicy black currant fruits show promise for the future. Drink from 2018.",87
Roger Voss,Château de Rochemorin 2013  Pessac-Léognan,"This is rich in spice, herbal characteristics and tangy acidity. It has a strongly mineral edge along with green fruits and tight lemon zest. Drink from 2017. André Lurton bought de Rochemorin in 1973; the estate has grown vines since the 16th century.",87
Roger Voss,Gabriel Meffre 2015 La Châsse Sauvignon-Colombard White (Vin de France),"This typical blend from southwest France draws on the intensely herbal character of both grapes. It's crisp, perfumed and refreshingly fruity, making it a great apéritif.",85
Roger Voss,Gabriel Meffre 2016 La Châsse Chardonnay (Vin de France),"Soft and fruity, this is an easy-to-drink wine. Its creamy texture and balanced acidity complement its apple flavors. It's ready to drink.",85
Roger Voss,Wines & Winemakers 2016 Samora Rosé (Tejo),"A light, crisp blend of Merlot and Syrah, this is soft and gently fruity. Raspberry and red-currant flavors shine easily through this simple wine.",85
Michael Schachner,Zolo 2017 Sustainably Farmed Estate Grown and Bottled Torrontés (Mendoza),Tropical aromas of lychee and honeydew set up a straightforward palate. Powdery flavors of green melon and lychee are light and flowery on a modest finish.,85
Roger Voss,Adega Cooperativa de Borba 2016 Adega de Borba Branco White (Alentejo),"Crisp, bright and fruity, this is a refreshing and ripe wine. With attractive citrus acidity and a bright aftertaste, the wine is ready to drink.",85
Roger Voss,Adega Cooperativa de Borba 2016 Brado Branco White (Alentejano),"The very local Tamarez grapes make an appearance in this lemon-colored and flavored wine. It is fruity, soft and bright with acidity. Drink now.",85
Michael Schachner,Alta Vista 2016 Malbec Rosé (Mendoza),"Aromas of dish soap and fruit salad show on the nose while the palate brings pink grapefruit and orange. A citric finish with a peppery note lacks acidity, so drink now.",85
Michael Schachner,Aymara 2015 Estate Torrontés (Maipú),"Flat aromas of lanolin and oily white fruits lead to a round, full palate that's getting tired. Salty nectarine and flowery flavors finish with a yeasty note of ham and white fruits.",85
Roger Voss,Paul Buisse 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Touraine),"This is a light bright wine, full of forward fruitiness. The tangy edge of minerality gives the wine a pleasing texture. Citrus fruits support this texture with their zest and acidity. The wine is ready to drink.",85
Roger Voss,Saget la Perrière 2016 La Petite Perrière Pinot Noir (Vin de France),"This light, cool-climate Pinot Noir is crisp with red currant fruit and herbal-tinged acidity. It has a zesty character that keeps it lively and tight. Drink now.",85
Carrie Dykes,The Williamsburg Winery 2015 A Midsummer Night's White White (Virginia),"Popping with aromas of lychee, rose, geranium and violet this wine is quite perfumed. There are also citrus notes of lime zest and lemon curd. Flavors are perfumed and soapy as well, and it wine coats your mouth. The finish is long with a slightly bitter end.",85
Michael Schachner,Valentin Bianchi 2015 Sensual Malbec (Mendoza),"Lightly spicy raspberry aromas are raw and peppery. This feels fleshy and pulpy, with punchy acidity. Peppery berry flavors are boosted by toasty oak that carries over to a mildly hot finish.",85
Fiona Adams,Gruet NV Blanc de Blancs Chardonnay (America),Intense yeasty aromas lean a bit nutty with a suggestion of citrus. Aggressively frothy bubbles give way to cashews and bread dough showing hints of lemon. Grapefruit pith and peanut skin bring a slightly bitter note to the finish.,85
Roger Voss,Jean-Max Roger 2015 Le Charnay  (Menetou-Salon),"This is an easy, open wine that is lightly herbal. There is a barnyard edge that masks the fruit, although there is bright crisp acidity to give it a lift. Drink now.",85
Roger Voss,Magnum Vinhos 2015 Flor de Maio Mayflower Red (Alentejano),"Named after the poppy that blooms in May in the Alentejo, this wine is juicy and fruity, with a light touch of tannins. It is all red berries, with an easygoing juicy character, Drink now.",85
Roger Voss,Adega Cooperativa de Borba 2016 Brado Red (Alentejano),"Young and fruity, this is a bright and wine for immediate drinking. It has hints of tannins, plenty of red fruits and no wood.",85
Carrie Dykes,Blue Valley 2015 Muskat Ottonel (Middleburg),"Powerful aromas of lychee, mango and peach give a vibrant feel tropical to this wine. These aromas show the palate and are joined by peach candies and rosewater. With decent acidity, this still feels viscous on the palate and has a medium finish that ends with ginger spice.",85
Roger Voss,Vinadeis 2016 Le Val Merlot (Vin de France),"The sunshine of the Languedoc comes through in this wine's warm, soft fruit. A touch of acidity and a backdrop of tannins give it contrast and a fine, ready-to-drink character.",85
Roger Voss,Wines & Winemakers 2014 Dona Helena Reserva Red (Península de Setúbal),"Structured and with solid tannins, this is a wood- and spice-laden wine. Its fruit lies somewhere behind all this structure and is likely to remain there.",85
Michael Schachner,Zolo 2017 Sustainably Farmed Estate Grown and Bottled Rosé (Mendoza),"This youthful pink-colored number smells of dusty cherry and Lifesavers. A juicy palate has a soda-like feel, while flavors of raspberry and cherry are light and dilute across the finish.",85
Jim Gordon,Gnarly Head 2015 Pinot Noir (California),A bit of charred wood and black pepper in the aroma give way to lush berry and cherry flavors that spread across the palate and cling to the sides of the mouth. This wine is lightly oaky and has an attractive richness that lasts on the finish.,85
Joe Czerwinski,Jacob's Creek 2016 Chardonnay (Australia),"Tightly constructed for an entry-priced Chardonnay, this has faint almond nuttiness accenting pineapple and grapefruit flavors. Drink this medium-bodied wine through mid-2018.",85
Virginie Boone,Ca' Momi 2015 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"Full and ripe, this wine offers thick meaty flavors of pineapple and peach, finishing in sweet vanilla oak.",85
Roger Voss,Domaine de Reuilly 2015 Pinot Noir (Reuilly),This is a crisp cherry-flavored wine. Cool-climate Pinot Noir has a light texture that gives the wine a hint of tannins although it is much more about fruit and bright acidity. Drink now.,85
Roger Voss,Enoport 2014 Topázio Reserva Red (Douro),"There are firm and dusty tannins in this spicy wine. It has firm fruit, a solid texture and a juicy, nutmeg-flavored aftertaste. Drink from 2018 when some of the tannins have softened.",85
Roger Voss,Fiuza 2015 Tinta Miúda Red (Tejo),"Tinta Miúda, known as the rare Graciano grape in Spain, is not often found in Portugal. Here it makes a ripe, juicy and jammy wine that's soft, with only a minimum of tannins to keep it together. It has a typically warm character and is ready to drink.",85
Jim Gordon,Tie-Dye 2014 Red (North Coast),Substantial fruit flavors and a lightly sweet balance give this medium- bodied wine a decent drinkability factor. The mouthfeel is slightly tannic and the finish is brief.,85
Kerin O’Keefe,Il Chiosso 2010  Gattinara,"This offers earthy aromas of game, tilled soil, leather and forest floor. The lean rustic palate offers suggestions of dried cherry, a hint of dark spice and a gamy note alongside firm acidity and dusty tannins.",85
Jim Gordon,Grayson 2015 Lot 11 Chardonnay (California),"A light earthy, toasted aroma and mostly savory rather than outright fruity flavors mark this medium-bodied, dry wine. The texture is smooth and rich enough to complete a good picture.",85
Jim Gordon,Leaping Lizard 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"With ripe, generic fruit flavors, a soft texture and slight sweetness, this is a very easygoing, easy-drinking, light-bodied wine.",85
Michael Schachner,Portal del Montsant 2014 Bruberry Red (Montsant),"Cherry cough drop and minerally, almost chlorine aromas lead to an edgy high-acid hard palate. This blend of Carignan, Garnacha and Syrah tastes medicinal and like creamy but fiery red plum. A screechy-feeling, chocolaty-tasting finish leaves an impression.",85
Michael Schachner,Benvenuto de la Serna 2015 Mil Piedras Viognier (Vista Flores),"Lime and tangerine aromas are light and dusty, with a yeasty note. This feels mostly sound but basic, with leesy, melony flavors. On the finish, this loses intensity and turns bready in flavor and soft in feel.",85
Virginie Boone,Decoy 2013 Red (Sonoma County),"This plummy, dusty red wine is simple and straightforward in its approach to tannin and oak. Offered at a fair price it should please a wide range of palates.",85
Michael Schachner,Trapiche 2014 Oak Cask Malbec (Mendoza),"Reedy green-leaning aromas of plum and raspberry feed into a creamy palate. This tastes primarily of herbal red-berry fruits that finish oaky, dry and spicy.",85
Joe Czerwinski,Xanadu 2015 Exmoor Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon (Margaret River),"This shows some pungent, boxwood-like scents up front, followed by modest passion fruit and a bit of citrus, falling away on the finish. Drink now.",85
Roger Voss,Adega Mãe 2015 Pinta Negra Rosé (Lisboa),"Lisboa, with its cool climate, lends itself to crisp rosés like this. This lively fruity wine is touched by hints of vanilla and layers of red-fruit flavors. It is light and ready to drink.",85
Michael Schachner,Aniello 2015 006 Riverside Estate Merlot (Patagonia),"Dry earthy herbal aromas of tomato, red-berry fruits and oak set up a full palate with pounding tannins. This tastes roasted and herbal, with notes of bell pepper, tomato and creamy oak. A hard-tannin finish confirms that this Merlot skipped charm school.",85
Paul Gregutt,Oak Knoll 2014 Cloud Rest Vineyard Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"This is a neutral, papery white wine, with a flat, rather than lively mouthfeel. The apple flavored fruit is there, along with a touch of licorice, but the freshness seems to have been lost along the way.",85
Roger Voss,Parras Wines 2015 Mula Velha Reserva Red (Lisboa),"Mula Velha, “the old donkey,” is a younger wine than its name suggests. Brisk and fruity, it offers firm tannins and layers of blackberry fruit. With a touch of oak aging, the wine is developing well and will be ready to drink from late 2017.",85
Roger Voss,Parras Wines 2015 Terra Grande Red (Alentejano),"This wine is ripe, full of black fruits and soft tannins. With plenty of acidity to keep it crisp, the wine has a cool, flavorful character topped off by berry fruits. It's ready to drink.",85
Roger Voss,Quinta dos Avidagos 2015 Lote 138 Red (Douro),"This wine is light in tannins and ripe in fruit, with a delicious red-berry character. Drink this attractive wine from 2019.",85
Roger Voss,Château Lanscade 2015  Bordeaux,"This is a soft, ripe and fruity wine. It has gentle tannins and attractive red-berry fruits. There is just a touch of dryness that gives this easygoing wine its structure. Drink from early 2017.",85
Roger Voss,Château Troupian 2014  Haut-Médoc,"High-toast aromas are followed on the palate by flavors that are more about wood than fruit. That gives the wine a tough, extracted character that probably will not go away.",85
Roger Voss,Château Vrai Caillou 2015  Entre-Deux-Mers,"This is a crisp and fruity wine that's perfumed and full of citrus and green fruits. It has a lively character that is filled out with the ripe fruitiness of the vintage. The aftertaste, bright and fresh, suggests it will benefit from another few months. Drink from summer 2016.",85
Paul Gregutt,Cliff Creek 2011 Sams Valley Vineyard Claret (Southern Oregon),"Roughly equal portions of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot go into this tannic blend. It may be a little too far along the aging curve, at least for showing much fruit. It's drying out—displaying a touch of leather—and should be consumed as soon as possible.",85
Paul Gregutt,Del Rio 2013 Claret (Rogue Valley),"The Claret benefits from an additional year of bottle age, integrating the components (60% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% each Cab Franc and Malbec). Tart red-berry fruit is accented with light toast from barrel aging. There's a slight hint of burnt rubber that will blow off with decanting.",85
Paul Gregutt,Delfino 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Umpqua Valley),"This is a light simple red, without particular varietal character. It's much like an inexpensive California Merlot—fine for every day drinking, generic and unassuming.",85
Kerin O’Keefe,Gru 2015  Montepulciano d'Abruzzo,"This inky-colored zesty wine offers aromas of sour cherry, leather and a hint of dried herb. The extremely simple, easygoing palate shows red plum and a hint of clove alongside loose knit tannins.",85
Roger Voss,J. Portugal Ramos 2015 Pouca Roupa Branco White (Alentejano),"This wine is smooth and soft, with an attractive creamy texture and light acidity. Yellow fruits and stewed pears are lifted by a mineral texture. The wine is named after the vineyard rather than after the literal Portuguese meaning of “scantily dressed.” Drink now.",85
Jim Gordon,First & Local 2015 Chardonnay (California),"Light cinnamon and sugar aromas, and fresh, fruity and lightly sweet flavors make this wine easy on the palate. The texture is soft.",85
Michael Schachner,Amalaya 2015 Esperanza Por Un Milagro White (Salta),Oily aromas of citrus peel and lychee set up a lemony palate with pyrazine-influenced citrus flavors. Lychee is the lead flavor on a finish that's mildly bitter.,85
Joe Czerwinski,Half Mile Creek 2014 Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc (South Eastern Australia),"Wet stone and graphite scents up front give way to hints of honey and Earl Grey tea (bergamot). It's medium bodied and fades quickly on the finish, but it's a solid buy for under $10.",85
Jim Gordon,California Republic 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"This good, basic wine offers herb and cherry aromas, mostly crisp fruit flavors and a firm, tannic texture.",85
Kerin O’Keefe,Cantina Valle Tritana 2014 Capostrano  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo),"Aromas of dark-skinned berry, plum and blue flower come together on this. The simple palate offers morello cherry and a hint of clove alongside soft, not very persistent tannins.",85
Roger Voss,Château Doms 2014  Graves,This is a light and fruity wine that is ready to drink. It has spice and a layer of dry tannins that are acting as a support to the red fruits and acidity.,85
Roger Voss,Château Pindefleurs 2013  Saint-Émilion,This is a seriously wood-aged wine. Its burnt toast character doesn't chime with the light fruitiness of the vintage and so gives a wine that is bitter and extracted. Less overworking would have produced a better wine.,85
Paul Gregutt,Cliff Creek 2012 Sams Valley Vineyard Merlot (Southern Oregon),"This wine seems overtaken with scents and flavors of tree tar and resin. The impression of pine resin cuts out the fruit, leaving some woody flavors in the finish.",85
Paul Gregutt,Quady North 2007 Flagship Syrah (Applegate Valley),"Quady North's Flagship is what the owners consider the best lot of wine of the year. Generously slathered in toasty new oak, this very limited (two barrel) reserve from the estate's Frank's Vineyard is not the blockbuster of the previous vintage, but shows exceptional winemaking skills. Black cherry fruit is wrapped in woody tannins, a yin-yang combination that works by dissonance rather than harmony.",90
,Qupé 2010 Marsanne (Santa Ynez Valley),"A huge, ripe, opulent wine, rich in orange, butter, peach, honey and spice flavors. Shows great depth and power, yet finishes thoroughly dry and crisp. Should develop bottle complexities over the next six years. Blended with 15% Roussanne.",90
Joe Czerwinski,Réserve des Oliviers 2009 White (Châteauneuf-du-Pape),"Not a big, overwhelming blockbuster, this harmonious blend of equal parts Grenache Blanc, Roussanne, Clairette and Bourboulenc features ripe citrus and pineapple flavors, with a hint of melon thrown in for good measure. It's pleasantly medium bodied and creamy in the mouth, with a reasonably long finish. Drink it over the next 12–18 months.",90
Joe Czerwinski,Tardieu-Laurent 2007  Hermitage,"Like many of the '07 Hermitages, this isn't a huge wine, but instead shows a nice sense of proportion, marrying hickory smoke with touches of cracked peppercorns, cedar and roasted beef. Drink now–2020.",90
,Sant Agnese dei F.lli Gigli 2006 Libatio Red (Toscana),"Libatio shows nice integration with smooth tones of cassis, blueberry, white almond and dried spice. The results deliver balance and elegance and make this a food-friendly option for meat or hearty pasta dishes.",90
,Bonaccorsi 2008 Julia's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Flamboyantly rich in cherries, raspberries and cranberries that are a bit tart, yet enriched with sweet oak. Firm acidity brings everything to a clean, bright finish. A pretty wine, showing elegance and finesse.",90
,Chanin 2008 Bien Nacido Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),"Gavin Chanin makes this distinctive, interesting Chardonnay. Shows a ino Sherry-like yeastiness, and is minerally and streamlined. Zesty flavors of limes, kiwis and grapefruits round out the finish.",90
Virginie Boone,Cuda Ridge Wines 2008 Cabernet Franc (Livermore Valley),"Another Livermore Valley producer to watch, Cuda Ridge has fashioned a varietally textbook Cab Franc here, with an intensely woody, herbal nose. Medium-bodied, with tannins that are integrated and ready to soften, this Cab Franc, barrel-aged for 18 months, is really, really good, and ready to age another 3–5 years.",90
Michael Schachner,Doña Silvina 2006 Malbec (Mendoza),"Opens with rooty, baked aromas before finding its legs and plenty of ripe, attractive berry fruit. The palate is juicy and solid, with good acidity and nice flavors of wild berry, chocolate and toast. Stylish and very solid. Definitely a food-friendly Malbec.",90
Roger Voss,Dürnberg 2007 Impetus Select Red (Niederösterreich),"Bordeaux grapes mix with Zweigelt in this full-bodied, serious wine. It has initial severe tannins, followed by ripe currant and blackberry fruit. The wood aging gives good spice character. Well worth aging for 3–4 years.",90
,Il Veltro 2005  Brunello di Montalcino,"Il Veltro is a newish brand of Brunello from Montalcino that opens with bright berry nuances and background notes of spice, cola, tobacco and leather. The mouthfeel is rich and firm, enduring but not too heavy or overdone.",90
Paul Gregutt,Lange 2010 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"Fruit-driven, with pear and apple, but an interesting streak of licorice running down the spine of the wine. It has depth and good structure, so the now-dominant young fruit will have support as it ages. Worth sitting on for a couple more years.",90
Roger Voss,Markus Huber 2010 Grüner Veltliner (Traisental),"Complex, mineral wine, crisp but also very, very textured. Flavors of peach and red apples work with pink grapefruit to give the fruit character, while there is also a more serious complexity of green herbs. The finish is soft, still mineral. Screwcap.",90
,Massi di Mandorlaia 2007 Colpetroso  (Maremma),"Rosemary-marinated steak, roast pork roll stuffed with prunes or dark chicken or turkey meat would make perfect paring partners to this red blend from southern Tuscany. Aromas of spice, mature cherry and leather are soft and penetrating.",90
Paul Gregutt,Melrose 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Umpqua Valley),"Fragrant with a mix of sweet grass and dusty blossom, this pleasant Sauvignon Blanc makes you wonder why the grape is so rare in Oregon. Here in the Umpqua Valley it finds a sweet spot, fresh and varietal, round and tart, with the added complexity of the flowery aromatics.",90
,Pieve Vecchia 2007 Pieve dei Monaci  (Maremma),"Sweet pipe tobacco and red cherry open the nose of this plush Syrah from Maremma, Tuscany. Soft, chewy tannins make this inky red wine appropriate to pair with grilled porcini mushrooms or veal in cream sauce.",90
,Piña 2007 Mimbre Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"As soft and smooth as velvet, with superripe flavors of chocolate, blackberry and cherry pie filling, currants, cassis and sweetly toasted oak. A best blend of vineyards available to the winery, this Cab was aged in 100% new French oak. The alcohol level is high, leading to questions of ageability.",90
,Qupé 2009 Sawyer Lindquist Vineyard Grenache (Edna Valley),"Lots of tannins and acidity on this dry Grenache, but it's so rich and sweet in cherries, you can drink it now. Somehow manages to be fun and serious at the same time. A real success for this finicky variety in California.",90
,Qupé 2010 Bien Nacido Cuvée White (Santa Maria Valley),"An unusual blend of Viognier and Chardonnay, the wine is brilliantly dry and crisp. It's rich and spicy in citrus, tropical fruit and spice flavors, brightened with bracing acidity. Opulent, yet crisp and refreshing.",90
Joe Czerwinski,Tardieu-Laurent 2009 Vieilles Vignes White (Châteauneuf-du-Pape),"Rich and broad in the mouth, with notes of honeyed citrus reminiscent of tangerine and a tang of peppery spice. The finish is warm, spicy and long, with a hint of vanilla oak. Drink it now and over the next year or two for its undeniable richness.",90
,Tessa Marie 2009 Grenache Blanc (Santa Barbara County),"Rich and opulent, showing masses of honeydew melon, orange crème, vanilla and spicy flavors. Really seductive, so easy to like. A touch of oak adds just the right note of smoke. Great with roast pork.",90
Roger Voss,Türk 2008 Eiswein 375ml Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),"With fruit picked on January 7, 2009, this superrich wine shines with acidity that picks out the fuller honey flavors. It has an almost unctuous texture, very smooth, with orange zest and peach giving a fresh side to the wine.",90
,Ugly Duckling 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"In a word, wow. What a wonderful Cabernet Sauvignon. It has got to be one of the best buys out there, so rich and smooth in berry, cherry, currant and spice flavors. Only 640 cases were produced, but worth a search. Drink now.",90
Michael Schachner,Finca Vides 2009 Torcidas Malbec (Mendoza),"Solid and smooth from the beginning, with cola, pastry and blackberry aromas. The palate is fresh, full and healthy, with cola, black pepper and a ton of berry push. Toasty and roasted on the finish, where coffee comes into play. Right on the spot for value-priced Malbec.",90
,Petra 2003 Quercegobbe Merlot (Toscana),"The fruit appears very ripe, almost too ripe, making the wine difficult to pair with food because of the width and intensity of its jammy nose. Yet more harmonious tones of chocolate, coffee and spice kick in at the rear to add dimension.",86
Lauren Buzzeo,Recanati 2006 Kosher Chardonnay (Galilee),"While oak can commonly overwhelm Chardonnay, this is a perfect example of an appropriate balance. Toasted notes of almond and peach pit intertwine with red apple and underripe pear; crisp acidity shines through on the finish.",86
,Terralsole 2005 Solista Syrah (Toscana),"As much as Tuscany and Syrah seem to be a match made in heaven, this wine is lower in overall intensity and rather neutral in aromas. Pretty cherry-berry and fine wood nuances are measured and understated. Firm structure and tannins, with a tart cherry note on the close.",86
,Tommasi 2005 Poggio al Tufo Rompicollo  (Maremma),"Amarone producer Tommasi has produced this approachable blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet. The aromas are simple but direct, including cherry, spice and vanilla.",86
Roger Voss,Caves Aliança 2006 Galeria Bical (Bairrada),"Rounded but also fruity, this soft wine is perfumed, hinting at white flowers and tropical fruits. While the acidity is low, the fruit is easy, ripe and lightly structured.",86
Michael Schachner,Bodegas Cerrosol 2006 Doña Beatriz Sauvignon (Rueda),"This tiny production SB is sweet and easygoing, with canned peach aromas along with pineapple and mild citrus flavors. Roundness and a smooth feel work in the wine's favor, because there's just enough acidity to push the length on the finish. Drink right away.",86
,Dry Creek Vineyard 2006 Fumé Blanc (Sonoma County),"The '06 vintage was kind to the winery's basic Sauvignon Blanc, providing a clean, crisp, dry white with flavors of lemon, lime, pineapple, nectarine and honey, and a zingy touch of tart gooseberry. Shows a complexity you don't usually find at this price.",86
Susan Kostrzewa,Prejean 2006 Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),"Pronounced minerality and fresh, bright fruit are balanced nicely in this stylish wine. A touch of spice adds dimension. Pair with poultry dishes.",86
Lauren Buzzeo,Kadesh Barnea 2004 Estate Bottled Reserve Kosher Cabernet Sauvignon (Negev Hills),"The 18 months of aging in 90% American oak really shows in the forward flavors and aromas of vanilla and mocha. Some black fruit shines through on the palate in the form of cassis and black cherry. Balanced and round, though generally light weight.",86
,Antonino Tringali-Casanuova 2005 Patrimonio Sangiovese (Toscana),"A ripe, thickly extracted Sangiovese that offers loads of blueberry fruit and cookie dough aromas. It's surprisingly thick and creamy in the mouth with toasted nut flavors on the close.",86
Joe Czerwinski,Tyrrell's 2006 Lost Block Chardonnay (South Eastern Australia),"This medium-bodied Chardonnay features ample apple, pear and pineapple fruit that comes across as pleasant and mouthfilling, if also a bit one-dimensional. Still, it represents a reasonable value.",86
Joe Czerwinski,Vasse River 2006 Chardonnay (Margaret River),"This is a straightforward, plump, fruity Chardonnay. Round peach and lemon flavors get a burst of energy from hints of pineapple and citrus, finishing clean and fresh. Drink now.",86
Michael Schachner,Vega de la Reina 2006 Verdejo (Rueda),"Starts out sharp and funky, and then quickly you realize that it's showing signs of age. The wine blends sweet and sour notes on both the bouquet and palate, issuing primary grapefruit flavors and some mustard greens on the finish. But the feel is chunky and it's losing its zest day by the day.",86
,Villa Vignamaggio 2003 Wine Obsession I Miti Red (Toscana),"The packaging is totally crazy but the wine is more subdued. A blend of Syrah, Merlot and Cabernet, it delivers raw strawberry, green leaf notes and loads of dried hay. It has a sharp, solid build and rigid tannins.",86
,Vinum Cellars 2006 Vista Verde Vineyard Viognier (San Benito County),"This Central Coast vineyard has produced an extraordinarily rich, vibrant Viognier, brimming with tropical fruit, wildflower, honey and vanilla-spice flavors. It benefits from crisp acidity, and finishes clean and off-dry.",86
Michael Schachner,Analivia 2006 Verdejo (Rueda),"While we'd suggest waiting for the 2007 to hit the market, this softer-styled wine is showing mature melon, tropical fruit and bee's wax aromas in front of mild citrus, lemon and pineapple flavors. It has a medium-weight body and almost a honeyed roundness. Drink now.",85
Joe Czerwinski,Battle of Bosworth 2005 Shiraz-Viognier (McLaren Vale),"Seems almost sweet, with cherry and chocolate flavors that dominate the palate. Drink now.",85
,La Gerla 2003 Birba Sangiovese Grosso (Toscana),"This Sangiovese from a hot vintage definitely seems past its peak. It has a very sweet-smelling, cherry-driven nose with a touch of marmalade that is blasted by a sudden rush of oak wood.",85
Roger Voss,Quinta do Grifo 2004 Reserva Red (Douro),"A firm wine, with dark chocolate and coffee flavors. The fruit flavors are  dark fig and stewed plums; there is a bitter edge to the tannins.",85
Lauren Buzzeo,Recanati 2004 Kosher Reserve Shiraz (Galilee),"Raspberry and cherry mingle with essence of mocha, tomato and pepper. Solid structure, full flavors and smooth tannins create a clean yet gripping texture, finishing strong and lengthy.",85
,St. Clement 2006 Chardonnay (Carneros),"Here's a likeable Chard, with peach, pear and fig flavors that have a distinctly herbal edge, like dried sage. Turns buttery and vanilla-y on the finish.",85
Roger Voss,Quinta da Alorna 2006 Touriga Nacional (Ribatejano),"A soft, lightly sweet style of rosé, flavored with strawberries and a touch of caramel. Fresh, and flavorful, with balancing acidity, this is a good apéritif wine.",85
Michael Schachner,Torres 2006 Viña Esmeralda Moscatel (Catalunya),"This wine is a “product” in every sense of the word. It's consistent from year to year, and if you know Esmeralda, with its sweet blend of Moscatel and Gewürz, then you know that it delivers simple but pleasant lime, kiwi and cantaloupe flavors with a certain watery freshness.",85
,Renwood 2006 Pinot Grigio (Lodi),"With a honeyed edge of sweetness to the pineapple and lime flavors, this wine also has a zesty acidity that makes it finish with mouthwatering cleanness. It's easy to like, a nice late afternoon cocktail sipper, and good with baked ham or pot stickers.",85
Michael Schachner,Tapeña 2006 Verdejo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),"Clean, wet, a bit sweet and rather formulaic, this Verdejo has a soft, chummy personality and seemingly more than a dash of residual sugar. Still, it manages to push tasty apple cider, papaya and other fuller-bodied, less acidic flavors.",85
Michael Schachner,Marqués de Cáceres 2006 Blanco Fermentado en Barrica White (Rioja),"The winery has dialed back the time in oak for its barrel-fermented Viura to two months from five or six, and it's a decidedly less oaky wine than in years prior. Now it shows a controlled lees character along with lemon and apple flavors. Limited in what it offers, but made well.",85
Michael Schachner,Bodegas Campante 2006 Versatus White (Ribeiro),"White raisin and touches of lettuce and celery give this multigrape blend some richness but also a bit of green character. The palate shows lemon, green apple and pineapple, and this lean quality is confirmed by the wine's modest 11% alcohol level. Drink now to catch it at its scouring, sorbet-like best.",85
Joe Czerwinski,Brick Road 2005 Nine Gums Vineyard Shiraz (McLaren Vale),"Tart blackberry and vanilla flavors mark this bold Shiraz that shows its 14.5% alcohol. There's a rubbery note on the nose that's a bit distracting but should be taken care of by a quick decanting, while black olive and coffee notes emerge on the slightly warm finish.",85
Susan Kostrzewa,Chaddsford 2005 Barrel Select Pinot Noir (Pennsylvania),"The earthy spice character of this masculine but poised Pinot makes it a unique and stylish pick for red wine lovers. Flavors are balanced, the acids are in check and the finish is delicate but spicy. Overall, a nice wine with class.",85
Susan Kostrzewa,Ventosa 2005 Chardonnay (New York),"Layers of round, appealing Chardonnay aromas lead into this nicely balanced offering from New York. Earthy spice and good acidity give the wine both complexity and elegance, and the finish is lengthy. A good wine for solo sips or pairing with poultry and fish.",85
Michael Schachner,Bodegas Riojanas 2006 Monte Real Gran Reserva  (Rioja),"For classic Rioja, Monte Real is always a good bet. This offering delivers textbook aromas of dried raspberry and cherry offset by fallen leaves and a pinch of seashell. The palate is still quite fresh, while black cherry, raisin, spice and cocoa flavors finish smooth and long, with a touch of oxidation and a Sherry note for added complexity. Drink through 2022.",92
Roger Voss,Château de Malle 2011  Sauternes,"Laced with acidity, this is a complex, structured wine with great freshness as well as a dry core of botrytis. It has a rich potential, closed at the moment but holding dense texture and balance between lemon and honey. Drink from 2019.",92
Matt Kettmann,Presqu'ile 2012 Steiner Creek Vineyard Pinot Noir (San Luis Obispo County),"Coming from an extreme coastal vineyard three miles north of Cambria, this cool-climate study offers aromas of blistered cherry tomatoes, Eastern European goulash spices and crushed peppercorns of all colors. It's fresh and lively on the palate, with hints of rose and tart raspberry. At the same time, it's quite vegetal, with green notes that will evolve into more balanced umami flavors from 2017 to 2022.",92
Matt Kettmann,Sante Arcangeli 2013 Split Rail Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains),"From a vineyard 1,700 feet above the small town of Corralitos comes this tasty wine that begins with aromas of smoked apple, lemon zest, honeysuckle and sea salt, as well as a struck-match element. The palate shows flavors of fresh apple, chamomile and a dusting of crushed vanilla, all set against a chalky grip.",92
Sean P. Sullivan,Sixto 2012 Uncovered Chardonnay (Washington),"A blend of fruit sources used for the winery's three single-vineyard wines, this bottling saw no new oak and is light golden in color with reserved notes of mineral, almond, pineapple and lees. Full bodied, rich and layered with a creamy feel, it's appealing now but should have a long life ahead.",92
Sean P. Sullivan,Syncline 2013 Subduction Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This blend of Syrah, Mourvèdre, Carignan, Counoise, Grenache and Cinsault immediately appeals with its aromas of plum, candied raspberry and garrigue, with no oak influence anywhere in sight. It's fruit laden, focused and supple, with a feel that dazzles the senses and pure fruit flavors that just won't quit.",92
Kerin O’Keefe,Lambardi 2010  Brunello di Montalcino,"Classic Sangiovese aromas of underbrush, pressed powder, violet and wild berry mingle in the glass. The vibrant palate offers layers of black cherry, dried red cherry, white pepper, truffle and savory herb alongside firm but refined tannins and bright acidity. This is all about polish and finesse. Drink 2018–2028.",92
Roger Voss,Le Carré 2012  Saint-Émilion,"Rounded and rich, this generous, full-bodied wine comes from a single parcel in the heart of Saint-Émilion. Black fruits are structured with dense tannins and a firm tension between ripeness and dryness. The wine is powerful, finishing with pepper and spice. Drink from 2018.",92
Sean P. Sullivan,Two Vintners 2012 Some Days Are Stones Stoney Vine Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Whereas many Syrahs from this vintage from the Rocks District show more fruit than usual, this wine is clearly rooted in the stones. It's aromatically expressive with black olive, crushed flowers, mineral, black pepper and an earthy funk. Flavors are silky soft in feel, with a well-balanced mixture of fruit and savory notes that leads to a lingering finish.",92
Sean P. Sullivan,Va Piano 2012 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This blend of Les Collines (60%), Lewis (20%) and Portteus (20%) vineyards, which saw 25% new French oak, offers blueberry and huckleberry along with herb and dark chocolate accents. It's supple and soft in feel, deft but with depth to the fruit flavors.",92
Kerin O’Keefe,Tenuta San Giorgio 2010 Ugolforte  (Brunello di Montalcino),"This opens with an enticing fragrance of rose, violet, dark berry and underbrush. The firm palate delivers juicy wild cherry, cinnamon and star anise alongside firm but fine-grained tannins and bright acidity. Drink 2018–2028.",92
Matt Kettmann,Le P'tit Paysan 2013 Jack's Hill Chardonnay (Monterey County),"Ian Brand explores fringe growing regions to deliver well-priced and fun wines for this label. This shows aromas of tight nectarine and Granny Smith apple, and the flavors are laser-focused with apple skins, yellow grapefruit pith and steely gunmetal. Its intense energy is a little wound up now, but will blossom with time.",92
Kerin O’Keefe,Lisini 2008 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),"Aromas of tilled earth, leafy forest floor, porcini mushroom, truffle and ripe berry lead the nose. The palate offers wild cherry layered with medicinal herb, black pepper and grilled sage supported by firm tannins. It's still young and a bit disjointed so give it time to come together. Drink after 2018.",92
Matt Kettmann,Mesa Del Sol 2009 Syrah (Arroyo Seco),"The aging program for this Syrah, which comes from a vineyard near the intersection of the Carmel and Salinas valleys, results in a solidly balanced wine. Pepper, boysenberry and game consume the nose, with blackberry fruit, mint, tobacco and a greenish bitterness keeping the palate interesting.",92
Kerin O’Keefe,Ornellaia 2012 Le Serre Nuove  (Bolgheri),"This full-bodied red manages to be concentrated and weightless at the same time. It opens with aromas of blue flower, wild berry and a whiff of espresso. The smooth, almost creamy palate delivers a black cherry core while notes of graphite, clove, ground pepper and cake spice add depth. It's impeccably balanced, with velvety tannins and just the right amount of freshness. Drink through 2017.",92
Sean P. Sullivan,Analemma 2010 Atavus Vineyard Blanc de Noir Pinot Noir (Columbia Gorge (WA)),"This is an extremely rare beast—a single-vineyard, single-varietal (Pinot Noir), single-vintage sparkling wine. Aged sur lie for 42 months, it draws you into the glass with notes of smoke, raspberry, mineral and nutty spices. The flavors are light and lively with tart, racy acidity and a long, lingering finish.",92
Jim Gordon,Bella 2012 Block 10 Zinfandel (Alexander Valley),"A deep, dark color, unusually ripe and exotic aromas, and intense flavors recalling boysenberry syrup make this a monster Zin. It's not very tannic or astringent, but the body is so rich and the alcohol relatively high that it oozes power and concentration. This will be great after a meal with cheese or chocolate.",92
Kerin O’Keefe,Centolani 2010 Poggiotondo  (Brunello di Montalcino),"Aromas of menthol, dried flower, ripe berry, leather and savory herb lead the nose. The rich palate delivers crushed wild cherry, stewed plum, cinnamon, anise and a hint of vanilla alongside round tannins. Despite its big, friendly structure, it also boasts finesse. Drink through 2022.",92
Roger Voss,Château Bouscaut 2012  Pessac-Léognan,"Meaty and spicy, this wine is in an early stage of development. It has dark tannins that have an extracted, tough character. However, the weight of ripe fruit is all there, promising a rich and concentrated wine for the future. Drink from 2020.",92
Roger Voss,Château Couhins 2012  Pessac-Léognan,"New-wood spice dominates the aroma of this wine, given weight by the rich black plum fruits and concentrated acidity. With its big structure and equally big fruits, this is an impressive wine for long aging. Drink from 2022.",92
Roger Voss,Château d'Arche 2011  Sauternes,"This wine has yeasty aromas and a light character that brings out springy acidity before the dry botrytis. It is still forming itself around the dry core, waiting to become generous and rich. Drink from 2019.",92
Roger Voss,Château Gaudin 2011  Pauillac,"One of the few great values from Pauillac, this 10-acre estate has produced an attractive perfumed wine that expresses both ripe black fruit and great structure. It's not a wine for long aging with its already-fragrant acidity. It has sweet tannins, delicious fruitiness and a lengthy aftertaste. Drink from 2019.",92
Roger Voss,Château Phélan-Ségur 2012  Saint-Estèphe,"As is often the case with Phélan Ségur, there is an excess of wood in this wine. Sometimes it works, as here, because the big, bold fruits are powerful enough to match the toastiness. That suggests a future as a ripe, black-fruited and structured wine with room for juicy acidity. Drink from 2019.",92
Jim Gordon,Darcie Kent Vineyards 2012 De Mayo Block Chardonnay (Livermore Valley),"This barrel-fermented wine has opulent aromas of nougat, butterscotch and pear tart. Equally interesting flavors stress the spice and pastry notes rather than straightforward fruitiness. It is attractively rich in mouth feel, dry, full-bodied and grand in style.",92
Roger Voss,Univitis 2013 Château Les Vergnes  (Bordeaux),"Forward red fruits give a good beginning to this light and fruity blend of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon. It is crisp with red currant flavors and layers of acidity. Drink now.",84
Michael Schachner,Volver 2014 Tarima Sparkling (Alicante),"Briny lemon-lime aromas are simplistic. This blend of Moscatel and Merseguera is foamy, while good acidity keeps it on a level plane. Ripe, sweet flavors of lychee, honeydew and mango are pure Moscato, while acidity from the Mersequera helps this along.",84
Sean P. Sullivan,Washington Hills 2014 Late Harvest Riesling (Washington),"This is a straightforward quaffer. Aromas of herbs, jasmine and stone fruit lead to sugary-sweet fruit flavors.",84
Michael Schachner,Finca La Pica 2011 Crianza  (Rioja),"From the beginning, this crianza from a very good vintage is lacking. The nose is mulchy and cheesy, with almost no fruit character. The palate is edgy in feel, while leafy, stalky red-fruit flavors are salty and taste of vanilla and caramel.",84
Roger Voss,Château Saint-Urban 2013  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux,Jammy fruits conflict with a firm tannic structure. This wine is not yet balanced and needs a lighter touch. Producer is Jean Paul Barre.,84
Michael Schachner,Conde de Subirats NV Brut Rose Sparkling (Cava),"Aromas of rhubarb, herbs and strawberry mark the nose. This feels solid and mostly fresh, while flavors of pickled rhubarb and briny plum come with sugary sweetness in front of a salty finish.",84
Sean P. Sullivan,Crayelle Cellars 2013 Bishop's Block Red (Ancient Lakes),"This wine is a field blend of Syrah, Mourvèdre and Grenache from Bishop's vineyard. Aromas of herbs, berry, cumin and wet copper penny are followed by smooth-feeling dark berry flavors with a tart, mesquite-filled finish.",84
Roger Voss,Domaine Beausejour 2014 Les Grenettes Sauvignon Blanc (Touraine),"Lemon and spice make this a fruity while textured wine. It tastes like the chalk soil from which it comes, very mineral and flinty. This wine is all fruit now and will broaden out from 2016.",84
Roger Voss,Les Rocailles 2014 Pinot Noir (Vin de Savoie),"This is just recognizably Pinot Noir, full of tannins with a tight edge. Bitter cherry flavors and very fresh acidity give a mineral flavor that is only just showing juiciness. Drink from 2016.",84
Michael Schachner,Niel Santofimia 2013 Red (Almansa),"Charred, blackened aromas of mint, licorice and burnt tire overshadow the wine's black-fruit components. This feels thick and dense, with chewy weight. Medicinal, herbal flavors of black fruits are peppery and a bit green, while mint and cough drop notes control the finish of this 85% Garnacha Tintorera and 15% Monastrell blend.",84
Roger Voss,Producta Vignobles 2013 Mission St. Vincent  (Bordeaux),"While this wine has a strong tannic structure, it also offers plenty of ripe fruit. Acidity is kept in its place, giving freshness allied to warm berries. Drink this attractive wine from 2016.",84
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Silver Thread 2014 Randolph O'Neill Vineyard Riesling (Cayuga Lake),"Apple and pear notes have a slightly savory tone in this brisk, lemony dry Riesling. Throughout a tasting of two samples, there are lingering tones of rubber and struck matches that blow off gradually with aeration.",84
Virginie Boone,V. Sattui 2012 Malbec (Napa Valley),"This juicy red wine offers thick layers of black pepper and blueberry around sturdy oak. However, its opulent beginnings start to thin on the midpalate, veering into sour flavors and a touch of heat.",84
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Ventosa 2013 Riesling (Seneca Lake),"Sweet green apple, lemon and lime notes meld in this off-dry Riesling, somewhat evocative of green Jolly Rancher's candy. Whiffs of smoke and nuts add a savory dimension to this brisk, easy drinking wine. Drink now.",84
Michael Schachner,Biutiful NV Brut Rose Garnacha (Cava),"Pickled, briny aromas of citrus and berry fruits are modest. On the palate, this is soft and low on acidity. Flavors of raspberry, cherry and red currant are mild, with a touch of bitterness.",84
Roger Voss,Cap Royal 2014  Bordeaux Blanc,"This crisp, fruity wine is fresh with citrus, grapefruit and an attractive zesty texture. Aromatic and bright, it is ready to drink now, clean and fragrant.",84
Sean P. Sullivan,Cave B 2014 Dry Rosé (Ancient Lakes),"All Merlot, this pale-pink wine offers aromas of herbs, grass and cherry. Though the label suggests otherwise, it drinks off dry, with pit-fruit flavors.",84
Roger Voss,Château Barreyre 2013  Bordeaux Supérieur,"Too much extraction has given this wine a dry character. It does have juicy red fruits underneath and these should come out as the wine ages. It is likely, though, always to be a dry wine.",84
Roger Voss,Château Laronde Désormes 2013  Bordeaux Supérieur,"This firm, smoky wine with fine tannins and ripe fruit is developing well, allowing the berry fruits to come through the structure. Give this wine until late 2016.",84
Michael Schachner,Château Los Boldos 2013 Grand Reserve Syrah (Cachapoal Valley),"Flat boysenberry and plum aromas are jammy and a bit floral. This feels clipped and rugged, with reedy plum and raspberry flavors that finish short.",84
Roger Voss,Château Roquevieille 2013  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux,"From owner Jean-Pierre Palatin's vineyards at the highest elevation in this appellation, this mostly Merlot wine is soft and fruity, ripe but with little sense of structure. It is juicy and with some acidity. Light and perfumed, it is ready to drink. The winemaker is Thomas Guibert who also handles Ferrand, Palatin's Saint-Émilion grand cru.",84
Jim Gordon,Cocobon 2013 Red (California),"A very deep red color catches the attention. Next, strong, wild aromas like smoke and black rubber lead to a rather fruity but still firm and tannic texture. The flavors are more like blackberries and blueberries, but the overall effect is slightly viscous.",84
Roger Voss,Domaine de la Sanglière 2014 Juliette Rosé (Mediterranée),"Soft, ripe and fruity, this spicy wine has attractive acidity. It offers a light texture, pepper and a bite of orange zest at the end.",84
Michael Schachner,Doña Isadora 2012 Carmenère (Central Valley),"Herbal berry aromas include a heavy dose of spent coffee grinds and oak. This has an edgy, hard mouthfeel and oaky flavors of plastic and vanilla that sit on top of herbal berry notes. A creamy finish maintains the wine's oaky theme.",84
Virginie Boone,Ehret 2010 Bellarina Meritage (Knights Valley),"Dark, dry and puckering with a stewed plum aroma and flavor, this wine offers a depth of tannin and herbal notes. A blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Cabernet Franc and 8% Merlot, it spent 20 months in French oak.",84
Roger Voss,Château de Belcier 2013  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux,"Ripe and jammy with attractive soft fruits and acidity, this wine has crushed strawberry and light spice flavors. Drink from late 2016. MACIF, a mutual insurance company, bought the estate in the 1980s and restored the vineyards and beautiful château. The estate manager is Fredéric Dubois and consultant is Georges Pauli.",84
Roger Voss,Château des Tourtes 2012  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux,"This wine is concentrated, with fruit that seems too ripe. Jammy berry flavors are mixed in with dry tannins and a firm backdrop. It's solid, although not quite balanced. The estate was founded in 1967 by Philippe Raguenot; daughters Emmanuelle and Marie-Pierre took over in 1997.",84
Roger Voss,Château Donjon de Bruignac 2013 Premium  (Bordeaux Supérieur),"While there are firm tannins, this wine also has plenty of fresh black currant fruits. Acidity and a crisp texture give it a lift and brightness. Drink this 100% Merlot from 2016 when the tannins have softened.",84
Roger Voss,Château Godard 2013  Francs Côtes de Bordeaux,"Perfumed strawberry aromas show well. On the palate, this wine is fruity, jammy in texture with good balancing acidity. The tannins still need to soften, so drink from 2017.",84
Roger Voss,Château Haut Boilon 2013  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux,"Firm but with juicy fruit, this 80% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon blend is a solid, still young, wine. The aftertaste is tough and packed with acidity.",84
Paul Gregutt,Helix by Reininger 2011 Stone Tree SoRhô Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This Southern Rhône-style blend is roughly half Mourvèdre, 31% Grenache and 17% Cinsault. It's a delicious match-up, with the Mourvèdre underscoring the minerality, and providing grip and texture around the racy red berry flavors of the other two grapes. The wine has a spine of steel, suggesting it will age through 20206–2022.",91
Kerin O’Keefe,Capanna 2009  Brunello di Montalcino,"Classically crafted, it opens with a fruit-driven fragrance of bright red berries accented with whiffs of cooking spices and balsamic herbs. The juicy palate delivers fleshy black cherry, black raspberry, black pepper and exotic spices alongside big, velvety tannins. Soft and delicious, this is already accessible so enjoy over the next few years.",91
Michael Schachner,Cellers Unió 2009 Roureda Llicorella Gran Selecció Vitis 60 Red (Priorat),"Jammy, ripe blueberry and blackberry aromas belie a crisp, tight palate, with wild berry, licorice and peppery flavors. This is fresh, wiry, firmly structured and alert as well as comfortable and controlled. Think classic Priorat to drink through 2018.",91
Roger Voss,Château Haut Bertinerie 2010  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux,"Hugely tannic, this formidable wine has great weight, richness and a dark and dense structure. Juicy berry fruits, sweet plum flavors and a dry, concentrated backdrop promise aging. Drink from 2018.",91
Roger Voss,Château Lalande-Borie 2011  Saint-Julien,"Perfumed, ripe and packed with blackberry fruits, this wine displays a great sense of elegance. It is fresh while the solid structure provides a contrast of tannins. The end shows acidity and fruitiness.",91
Roger Voss,Château Preuillac 2011  Médoc,"A strong Merlot element has produced a ripe, juicy wine, full of fruit balanced with a subtle use of wood. It's a powerful, concentrated wine that has impressive tannins, rich berry fruits and acidity. Drink from 2018.",91
Sean P. Sullivan,Koenig Vineyards 2011 Ice Wine Riesling,"This is a über aromatic wine with a long list of notes that include orange marmalade, peach, citrus, and drizzled honey. Harvested at 42 brix and retaining a whopping 240 g/L residual sugar, it's supremely rich and sweet with a lingering finish.",91
,Krutz 2011 Soberanes Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"The vineyard is famous for producing ripe, luscious Pinots stuffed with massive fruit. Many wineries have dipped into it over the years. Krutz's rendition is dry, balanced and full-bodied, with relatively high alcohol framing raspberry, cherry, cola, red plum, exotic spice and sandalwood flavors. It should age well through 2020–2022.",91
,Loring Wine Company 2012 Aubaine Vineyard Pinot Noir (San Luis Obispo County),"The vineyard is near if not entirely within the Arroyo Grande Valley appellation, and it shows that region's tannins, acidity and ripe, long hangtime flavors. The balanced 2012 vintage has given it tremendously ripe cherry, raspberry, red currant and cola flavors, yet the wine retains an exciting sense of control and balance. Give it until 2018–2019 in the cellar to gain traction.",91
,Loring Wine Company 2012 Durell Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"It's risky to suggest aging a California Chardonnay, but you'd do well to stash this away until sometime in 2015. Right now, the wine is all about brisk acidity, oak and fresh, ripe tropical fruit, orange and pear flavors. All those parts need time to come together.",91
Michael Schachner,Los Vencejos 2010 Malbec (Uco Valley),"Floral hints, latex, vanilla, oak and ripe berry aromas all show up on a fine bouquet. Ripe and creamy in feel, it holds dark, hard-pushing flavors of licorice, anise, coffee and blackberry. There's agility, elegance and complexity to this Malbec. Drink through 2017.",91
,Manzoni 2011 Estate Reserve Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"A rich barrel selection, this is a fine Pinot Noir that's silky, brisk in acidity, dry and deeply flavored in raspberries, cherries and Dr. Pepper cola. Give it at least until 2018 in the cellar.",91
Paul Gregutt,Amavi 2011 Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Half was whole-cluster fermented, yielding dense scents and flavors with black olive, herb and a touch of mocha. Cranberry, raspberry and cherry fruit flavors are smooth and detailed, and the tannins firm and polished.",91
Kerin O’Keefe,Bolsignano 2009 Grazia  (Brunello di Montalcino),"This earthy wine opens with aromas of meat juices, baking spices and black fruit together with notes of leather and balsam. The rich palate delivers dark red cherry layered with mint and a tad of milk chocolate alongside dusty tannins. It' well balanced and should age moderately well. Drink 2016–2024.",91
,Bouchaine 2012 Bouche d'Or Chardonnay (Carneros),"A beautiful wine to pair with desserts based on white fruits or simple but delicious vanilla sponge cake. Made from late-harvested Chardonnay, it's very sweet in apricots, lemons, vanilla and buttered toast, with a brisk edge of acidity for balance.",91
,Bucher 2012 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Since planting in 1997, Bucher Vineyard has been a renowned source of Pinot Noir for exceptional local wineries. Now the Bucher family is making their own wine, with good results. The wine is dry, fresh and keen in acidity, and has considerable weight, with ripe, forward raspberry, cherry, bacon, sautéed wild mushroom and exotic spice flavors. However, it's still too young. Begin to enjoy it around 2018.",91
Paul Gregutt,Syncline 2011 Mourvèdre (Red Mountain),"This is pure Mourvèdre from three excellent Red Mountain sites: Heart of the Hill, Ciel du Cheval and Grand Rêve vineyards. Tart, stony raspberry fruit carries a hint of cured meat and straw. The wine displays excellent length and a delicious purity.",91
Kerin O’Keefe,Uccelliera 2008 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),"Andrea Cortonese makes ripe, structured Brunellos and this is an impressive effort from the variable 2008 vintage. It opens with aromas reminiscent of black plum, chocolate, vanilla and leather. These carry over to the palate along with toasted notes, spice and espresso. The fruit is supported by assertive tannins that need time to soften. Drink 2015–2023.",91
Kerin O’Keefe,Villadoria 2004 Riserva  (Barolo),"From one of the best vintages in the last 15 years, this classic Barolo needs to be opened a couple of hours ahead of time to breathe. It's a bit shy on aromas but the palate delivers dried cherry, fig, tobacco, white pepper and black tea flavors. Youthful acidity accompanies silky tannins in this wine that is just starting to develop complexity. Drink through 2024.",91
Roger Voss,Château Cos d'Estournel 2011 Les Pagodes de Cos  (Saint-Estèphe),"Smooth and rich while remaining structured, this wine performs the role of second wine very well. The tannins are already rounded and the black currant fruit remains fresh. It should be ready to drink in 2016.",91
Roger Voss,Château de Roquebrune 2010 Cuvée Reine  (Lalande de Pomerol),"Solid and powerful, it has a great mix of very ripe fruit with dense tannins. Blackberry fruits, laced with licorice and dark chocolate, contrast with a juicy, lightly herbal element. This mainly Merlot wine is destined for a fine future. Drink from 2017.",91
Roger Voss,Quinta do Casal Branco 2014 Terra de Lobos Tinto Red (Tejo),"The local grape Castelão is blended with Cabernet Sauvignon in this soft, spicy and fruity wine. Red fruits and balanced acidity are given a shove by a lightly tannic structure. The wine is ready to drink.",85
Roger Voss,Real Companhia Velha 2014 Gewurztraminer (Duriense),"It seems perverse to plant Gewürztraminer in the Douro and this wine is as much a curiosity as it is attractively perfumed. Showing all the hallmarks of the grape, the palate carries flavors of lychee and rosewater, although it all seems muted. The acidity does give a final lift.",85
Roger Voss,Jean-Marc Burgaud 2014  Beaujolais-Villages,"This light, fresh Chardonnay has lively pear and apple flavors. A crisp texture gives zing to the brightly fruity wine. Drink now.",85
Roger Voss,Jean-Marc Burgaud 2014 Les Vignes de Thulon  (Beaujolais-Villages),"This wine is light, fruity and with only a slightly tannic character. Aromatic cherry flavors give freshness and bring out a jammy character. It's ready to drink.",85
Matt Kettmann,Jewelry Box 2012 Chardonnay (Central Coast),"Coming in a sparkly package befitting its name, this boxed wine shows honeysuckle and pineapple on the nose. On the palate, green apple flesh and pink apple skins prove tart and ripe at the same time, though without tons of body or finish. It's a solid deal though!",85
Michael Schachner,Juvé y Camps 2013 Essential Xarel-lo (Cava),"Cidery aromas are briny. This feels low on bubbles but propped up by citric acidity. Orange and lettuce flavors end in pedestrian fashion, with a note of green herbs. This Cava's moderate, straightforward personality is due to the fact that it's 100% Xarello.",85
Roger Voss,Lanson NV White Label Sec  (Champagne),"Lanson suggests adding fruit to this wine or using it as the base for cocktails. It is off dry, ripe and fruity in itself. A touch of toast suggests this bottling is not young. The wine confuses between crisp acidity and a soft, neutral texture. It will probably be best when it is part of a mixed drink.",85
Matt Kettmann,Magnolia Court 2013 Chardonnay (Central Coast),"Lots of stone fruit ripeness marks the nose of this wine, with aomas of nectarine and peach cut by the sharpness of apple skins. The palate is all green apples and lime juice.",85
Michael Schachner,Mamarracho 2014 The Issue of Inexpensive Wines is When They Are Not Good Enough Red (Valencia),"Staunch aromas of leather and animal hide ride heavily on top of rubbery blackberry scents. This feels solid but scattered, with cherry and cassis flavors that come across jammy. Rubbery notes and a mild cheesy oak character dominate the finish.",85
Michael Schachner,Mantel Blanco 2014 Verdejo (Rueda),"Stone-fruit aromas are the opening, and they're on the full, waxy, fleshy side. This weighs in with low acidity, and that results in broad flavors of papaya and green melon. A round finish, much like the nose, shows a fleshy component.",85
Jim Gordon,Red Rock 2013 Reserve Pinot Noir (California),"Savory aromas and flavors combine with a soft texture in this full-bodied wine. It smells smoky and roasted, tastes like pomegranate and cherry juice and has a streak of acidity but not much tannin.",85
Roger Voss,Quinta da Lapa 2014 Selection Branco White (Tejo),"A blend of Arinto and Tamarez, this wine is light and fruity, with attractive acidity and flavors of apricots sprayed with lemons. It has a light texture and a fresh, lively aftertaste. Drink now.",85
Roger Voss,Real Companhia Velha 2014 Quinta de Cidrô Sauvignon Blanc (Duriense),"While more herbal in character, this wine also carries grapefruit, lemon and quince flavors. It is fresh with a steely mineral character that adds some interest. Drink now.",85
Michael Schachner,Castillo de Liria 2014 Winemaker's Selection White (Valencia),"This blend of Merseguera and Sauvignon Blanc is modest as a church mouse, with clean but dilute green-apple aromas. An easygoing, round palate offers orange and lime flavors in front of a pithy, citrusy finish.",85
Michael Schachner,San Felipe 2013 Oak Cask Estate Bottled Malbec (Mendoza),"Damp, foresty, stalky aromas are backed by a chunky, slightly sticky feeling palate. Black cherry and mocha flavors set the stage for a ripe finish, with brown-sugar sweetness.",85
Michael Schachner,Tarantas 2014 Brut Sparkling (Cava),"Leesy vanilla aromas are scattershot and include bready notes of baked apple and pear. This feels round, plump and low on acidity. Flavors of grassy, green citrus and tropical fruits turn bitter before flattening out on a mild finish.",85
Virginie Boone,Decoy 2013 Pinot Noir (Sonoma County),"This is an earthy, rustic wine tasting of black cherry, cola and a mention of sage, medium bodied on the palate and softly textured. It will please a range of palates, showing varietal character with vigor.",85
Roger Voss,Domaine André Colonge 2014  Beaujolais,"This wine is tight, fresh with crisp red currant and red-cherry flavors. It is as bright as a button, fruity with layers of acidity that bring out a perfumed character at the end. The Colonge family has been growing grapes in Beaujolais since 1789.",85
Roger Voss,Domaine du Vissoux 2014 Les Griottes Rosé (Beaujolais Rosé),"Fresh and fruity, this is a ripe, cherry-flavored wine (hence the name Griottes, a type of cherry). It is light with a straight line of acidity that cuts through the attractive fruitiness. Drink immediately.",85
Roger Voss,Domaine Pral 2014 Les Pays de Pierres Dorées  (Beaujolais),"Banana aromas don't intrude too strongly into the fruity palate of this wine that has a crisp character. Tart red-berry fruits and and bright acidity give the wine a fresh, totally fruity appeal with only a hint of tannin. Drink now.",85
Roger Voss,Espaço Rural 2014 Alves Vieira Branco White (Alentejano),"Grassy, green aromas give this a herbal, crisp taste. It is tight and tangy, with green fruit aromas and a fresh aftertaste. Drink now.",85
Michael Schachner,François Lurton 2015 Piedra Negra Pinot Gris Alta Colección Rosado (Uco Valley),"Salmon-colored and spritzy, this rosé of Pinot Grigio smells stony and peachy. A zesty palate has sizzle and zest to it, while stone-fruit and minerally flavors are salty prior to a mildly bitter finish that tastes of pithy citrus.",85
Roger Voss,Georges Duboeuf 2014  Chiroubles,"Structured and firm, this wine has more in the way of dry tannins than of fruit. It presents a fine skeleton without much flesh, leaving a wine that is tight and extracted. It needs plenty of time, so drink from late 2016.",85
Roger Voss,Georges Duboeuf 2014 Domaine du Paradis  (Saint-Amour),"This structured wine has a tight, tannic, dry character. It is slow to develop, leaving the black cherry fruits still masked by the forward dryness. Drink from 2016.",85
Matt Kettmann,Limited by Cambridge Cellars 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Coast),"Forest berries, perfumed violets and pine needles entertain the nose on this widely available bottling. The palate shows dried herbs, tar and smashed blackberries.",84
Roger Voss,Loron et Fils 2014 Beau!  (Beaujolais),"This wine is totally fresh, with crisp red currant and riper banana flavors—a bright wine that's all fruit and refreshing acidity. The family has been in the wine business since 1811 and today works with some 50 small-production growers.",84
Michael Schachner,Adegas Moure 2013 Tradición Joven Red (Ribeira Sacra),"Damp, rubbery aromas of berry fruits and cured meat amount to a weird ensemble. This is decidedly grabby on the palate, with salty, herbal plum flavors. A leafy, herbal, mildly green finish wraps up this kitchen-sink blend of Mencía and other grapes.",84
Michael Schachner,Bocopa 2012 Alcanta Crianza Red (Alicante),"Oaky, jammy aromas are wayward and slightly green. This blend of Tempranillo and Monastrell delivers heavy tannins on a widespread but unfocused palate. Oaky, drying berry flavors are more bitter than fruity, while the finish is choppy in feel and woody in taste.",84
Virginie Boone,Cairdean Estate 2011 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),This wine offers appealing aromatics of caramel apple before delving into viscous territory on the palate. Flavors fall somewhat flat and the finish is muddled.,84
Paul Gregutt,Cardwell Hill 2014 Blanc de Noir Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"The Blanc de Noir name would suggest it's a sparkling wine; it is not. The label also reads Estate White Wine. It is not. Rather, it is a rosé of Pinot Noir, lightly orange in color. Flavors recall a Pop Tart sort of pastry, simple and slightly sweet.",84
Virginie Boone,Viluko 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),"Made from certified organic grapes, this wine is both savory and tannic, a tad muted on the nose and wanting in texture. Cassis and pipe tobacco stand out most.",84
Jim Gordon,Alias 2013 Secret Agent Red (California),"Vanilla and maple aromas lead to overtly fruity red cherry flavors with a touch of sweetness and a soft texture. It's pleasant to drink for those looking for a soft touch, with very mild acidity and no tannin to speak of.",84
Michael Schachner,Bodegas Paniza 2013 Agostón Viura-Chardonnay (Cariñena),"This Viura-Chardonnay blend smells odd, as if musky cologne was blended with body oil. The palate seems caught between heavy and racy, while flavors of candied white fruits, apple and pear come with residual sugar and a sketchy foundation.",84
Jim Gordon,Bota Box 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (California),"Smooth but tangy, this offers good fresh citrus aromas and flavors, a softer-than-usual texture but a bright, clean character that stays fresh on the finish.",84
Michael Schachner,Viña Arnáiz 2010 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero),"Chunky, raisiny lead aromas come with more than enough vanilla, mocha and creamy oak backing. This has a lazy, baked, tannic feel and heavy flavors of candied blackberry and creamy oak. It smells and tastes forced.",84
Alexander Peartree,Good Harbor 2011 Dry Riesling (Leelanau Peninsula),"Grilled peach and almond notes show on the nose, while the palate is tighter in profile, offering apple pomace and lemon rind.",84
Roger Voss,Kuehn 2013 Pinot Gris (Alsace),"Light and fruity, this is an attractive off-dry wine. It has a delicate spice character along with yellow fruits that are seasoned with pepper and acidity. Drink now.",84
Virginie Boone,Long Meadow Ranch 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This herbaceous Cabernet also contains 17% Petite Sirah but doesn't take that variety's character on as much as it does the more herbal Bordeaux grapes, namely Cab and Cab Franc. Earthy and somewhat austere, the wine is a blend of cassis and green pepper.",84
Virginie Boone,Mario Bazán 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Almost two years of barrel aging have impacted this wine, which also appears to have spent a fair amount of time in bottle. The fruit is subdued and the texture chewy in leathery tannins that feel dry and unresolved on the finish.",84
Virginie Boone,Medlock Ames 2011 Bell Mountain Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"From the winery's estate Bell Mountain ranch, a stretch of vineyard that reaches through Alexander Valley to the Russian River Valley, this is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, blended with Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Tight in cranberry and puckering oak, it needs to air before enjoying.",84
Jim Gordon,Peirano 2012 The Other Red (Lodi),"With aromas like sweet vanilla and candied cherries, and similarly syrupy flavors, this might make a better after-dinner wine than a table wine. The acidity and tannins are very subdued, so the overt fruitiness and oaky sweetness take over.",84
Virginie Boone,Marilyn Sauvignon Blonde 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Sweet and somewhat disjointed, this 100% Sauvignon Blanc offers ripe apricot and peach before becoming slightly sour and herbal on the finish.",83
Michael Schachner,Zudugarai 2013 White (Getariako Txakolina),"Oxidized, yeasty aromas are not fresh. On the palate, this is spritzy, but oxidation creates a yeasty, bready blanket on top of basic pear and papaya. It finishes flat.",83
Michael Schachner,Cascada Peak 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),Cinnamon and licorice gumdrop and sketchy cherry cough drop aromas make up the nose on this cloying Cab that also shows hard tannins. Baked berry and brown sugar flavors finish with little sizzle or balance.,83
Michael Schachner,Bouza de Carril 2013 Albariño (Rías Baixas),"Tired and oxidized on the nose, this offers just-adequate freshness on the palate, but the wine is losing steam. Flavors of oxidized white fruits and bitter citrus finish dully.",83
Michael Schachner,Eresma 2012 Fermentado en Barrica Verdejo (Rueda),"Gold in color, with a nutty, flabby nose. In the mouth, this is honeyed and mealy, while flavors of creamy oak, green herbs and stone fruits finish bland and soft.",83
Michael Schachner,Montevicor 2010 Garnacha (Calatayud),"Aromas of raw oak, paint and dark-berry fruits lead to a medium-bodied palate with candied, oaky, mildly bitter black cherry and plum flavors. A modest finish closes with lasting bitterness and medicinality.",83
Michael Schachner,Maximo 2012 Edicion Limitada Garnacha (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),"Grassy, stalky plum aromas are decent but not overly fresh. Without a lot of shape or body, this modest Garnacha is herbaceous and limited in red-fruit flavors. The finish is gone in a flash.",83
Jim Gordon,Witching Stick 2012 Fashauer Vineyard Zinfandel (Anderson Valley),"Both tart and tannic, it's unusually tight in personality, with a mouth-puckering texture, sharp fruit flavors and astringent finish. While there are too many soft and overripe Zins, this one goes pretty far the other way.",83
Alexander Peartree,Heritage 2013 Estate Reserve Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (Outer Coastal Plain),"Toasted sourdough bread and briny lemon show on the nose and palate, with dusty oak and slightly burnt toast on the finish.",83
Michael Schachner,Alamos 2013 Red (Mendoza),"Aromas of blueberry and cinnamon smell odd and forced. A wiry-feeling palate runs on punchy acidity, while short flavors of currant and raspberry are oaky and finish with little structure or character.",83
Roger Voss,Dopff Au Moulin 2013 Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"This is soft and lightly flavored. Fruit and some fresh acidity are there along with spice, but the wine seems muted.",83
Paul Gregutt,EdenVale 2007 Syrah (Rogue Valley),"Volatile and sharp, this well-aged (though current) release tastes of vanilla, maple syrup and cut tobacco. After lengthy aging (48 months) in 60% new oak, the wood flavors have taken over.",83
Michael Schachner,Alto Cinco 2012 Paniza Garnacha (Cariñena),"Prune and raisin aromas announce ripeness, which comes with woodsy, earthy, murky berry scents. This feels snappy at first, then more heavy and baked. Prune and spice cake flavors are clumsy, heavy and lack cohesion on the finish.",83
Michael Schachner,Black Box 2013 Malbec (Mendoza),"This is stalky, grassy and peppery smelling, with red-berry aromas. Rawness and sharp acidity keep the pulse up as basic flavors of plum and raisin take over. A modest finish keeps the course without evolving.",83
Virginie Boone,Hendry 2011 Hendry Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"An overpowering aroma of cured meat on the nose recalls walking into an Italian deli, something one associates more readily with Cal-Ital varieties. Super tannic on the palate, the wine is slightly bitter and perhaps underripe.",83
Virginie Boone,White Oak 2012 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"This has both a taste of vanilla-sugar on the palate and bristling acidity that demands attention, making for a wine that's slightly off-kilter. The presence of oak is restrained and the finish, in keeping with the theme, quite tart.",83
Paul Gregutt,Merrill Cellars 2012 Cotes du Rogue G-S-M (Oregon),"This GSM blend is soft and muted. It falls flat, with dull fruit and a wash of chocolate.",83
Kerin O’Keefe,Feudi del Pisciotto 2012 Giambattista Valli  (Cerasuolo di Vittoria),"The nose is rather closed but reveals whiffs of dark-skinned fruit. The diluted palate offers raw, red cherry alongside fleeting tannins.",83
Roger Voss,Château Beausejour-Duffau-Lagarrosse 2009  Saint-Émilion,"Fresh blackberry fruits give a smooth wine, rich and with an immediately attractive fresh acidity. It does have the density of fruit along with relatively soft tannins. At the back there is a more chocolate character.",94
Roger Voss,Château Clerc Milon 2009  Pauillac,This wine continues the upward progression of Clerc-Milon. It has weight and density while also showing sweetness and delicious acidity. A very complete wine.,94
Roger Voss,Château Magdelaine 2009  Saint-Émilion,"There is dense, ripe fruit here, although with an austere, serious edge. The wine has firm yet juicy blackberry fruits along with concentrated tannins. It is firm, dark, with the potential for good red berry fruits.",94
,Hundred Acre 2008 Few and Far Between Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"So soft and sweet, it's like a melted dessert pastry. Explodes in blackberry and cherry pie filling flavors, with the smoky, buttery toast of oak barrels. Defines deliciousness. The tannins are soft enough to drink this 100% Cabernet now, and it is probably best enjoyed over the next six years before it loses freshness.",94
,Monteverro 2008 Tinata Red (Toscana),"Tinata is a sultry blend of Syrah and Grenache, a Rhône-style blend unlike any other wine in the area. These grapes seem perfectly adapted to the little-known region of Capalbio in the southern part of Tuscany and deliver intense aromas of blackberry, leather, chocolate and cured meat. It's plush, rich and extremely long-lasting.",94
,Mazzei 2008 Castello di Fonterutoli Siepi Red (Toscana),"Siepi is a gorgeous 50-50 blend of Sangiovese and Merlot that delivers intense aromas of ripe black fruit, rum cake, leather, moist tobacco and Indian spice. It lasts long on the palate thanks to its fine, silky texture. This vintage is slightly leaner, but brighter than the 2007.",93
Paul Gregutt,Nefarious 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Wahluke Slope),"Firm and muscular, with mixed berries and cherry fruit, this beautifully defined Cabernet shows excellent penetration and focus. The finish is long, smoky, and carries a hint of gun metal.",93
Virginie Boone,Prospect 772 2009 The Brawler Syrah-Viognier (Calaveras County),"A stunning Syrah with 4% Viognier that's almost black in color and aching with deep, dark cherry and black licorice surrounded by a lush, dense herb garden. This is a heavy, rich California Syrah, practically a velvet curtain, that will appeal to Rhône aficionados and anyone with a taste for something big, accentuated by a smoky finish.",93
Paul Gregutt,Quilceda Creek 2008 Palengat Red Wine Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"Quilceda's single-vineyard Bordeaux-style blend is 76% Cabernet Sauvignon, 14% Cabernet Franc, 7% Merlot and 3% Petit Verdot, from a vineyard just across the road from Champoux. Dusty and fragrant, it suggests soft leather, toast, caramel and coconut, hiding its fruit at first in a wash of luxurious barrel flavors. That fruit emerges with some hours of decanting, a tart and racy mix of berry and sweet tomato.",93
,Castellare di Castellina 2009 Poggio ai Merli Merlot (Toscana),"Poggio al Merli is a 100% Merlot that shows a perfect marriage between variety and territory. It's an opulent, soft and round wine that is woven tight with blackberry, pipe tobacco, rum cake and a touch of black olive. Velvety tannins drive a long, intense finish.",93
Roger Voss,Castro Pena Alba 2007 Picos de Couto Grande Escolha Red (Dão),"Pitch-black wine, very dense. It is spicy with concentrated black fruits, layered with equally intense acidity. Wood, fruit and sweet berries are all there. Tannins surround this firm wine, promising aging over 5–6 years.",93
Roger Voss,Château de Pez 2009  Saint-Estèphe,"With layers of wood, this is a structured wine, driven as much by tannins as fruit. It will need time for the dark plum fruit flavors to come through—St.-Estèphe is always likely to be firmly textured.",93
Roger Voss,Château Gruaud Larose 2009  Saint-Julien,"Initially wood dominates, but this is a stage after bottling. Because then the ripe, smooth fruit comes in, pouring through with black fruits, very ripe and juicy. As this wine develops, this rich fruit will be its main character.",93
Paul Gregutt,Doyenne 2009 Métier Red (Yakima Valley),"The Doyenne Métier generally drinks very well right out of the chute, and this 2009 is no exception. Supple and concentrated, this blend of 51% Grenache, 32% Mourvèdre and 17% Syrah is an absolute riot of mixed berry fruit scents and flavors. Full, lush, dense and quite long in the finish, it's a spicy, brilliant bit of winemaking. Can it age? Undoubtedly. But good luck keeping your hands off it!",93
Lauren Buzzeo,Gérard Bertrand 2008 L'Hospitalitas - La Clape Red (Coteaux du Languedoc),"It's sad that only 5,080 bottles of this wine were produced, as it's truly a stunner. Dark and developed, complex and concentrated, this wine exhibits such superb balance and finesse, with nuanced notes of minerality, scrubland, whole tobacco leaf, black pepper and licorice root all gracing the dark fruit core of the nose and mouth. It's lush and full on the palate, and medium tannins provide a solid structure, making the wine drinkable now or ready to age.",93
,Terre del Marchesato 2008 Marchesale Syrah (Toscana),"One of the nicest Syrahs to come from Italy, Marchesale is a rich, inky wine with intense aromas of cherry, blueberry, cola, chocolate and leather. Balanced softness and freshness characterize the finish.",93
,Argiano 2006 L'Orciaia  (Brunello di Montalcino),"This wonderful Brunello opens with sultry aromas of black fruit, cherry, spice, leather and tobacco. It's a rich and penetrating wine with a soft, lush mouthfeel and a hint of crisp acidity on the close. You'll want to keep this treasure in your cellar for a few more years.",93
,Campo al Noce 2008 Syrah (Toscana),"This 100% Syrah from sunny coastal Tuscany offers extreme softness and richness with chocolate, cherry liqueur, blueberry and smoked bacon fat. Pair this rich wine with game meat or stew.",93
,Chandon NV Etoile Rosé Sparkling (Sonoma-Napa),"Based on Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, this luxe rosé bubbly is delicious to drink now. It's likeable for the array of strawberry, orange and lime flavors, with that savory sparkling wine yeastiness, and the bubbles are smooth and refined. Will set off many different foods, but sushi is a definite hit.",93
Roger Voss,Château du Tertre 2009  Margaux,"A wine that continues the impressive rise of du Tertre. It is becoming one of the sure values of Margaux, and this 2009 is both ripe and finely balanced. The acidity boosts the rich fruits, sweet tannins and the warm finish.",93
Roger Voss,Château La Conseillante 2009  Pomerol,"Densely rich, very sweet wine. It has some smoky tannins that give structure, along with a dark core of dry raisin and wood flavors. It has concentration and an opaque texture.",93
Paul Gregutt,Chester Kidder 2007 Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This ups the percentage of Cabernet to 60%, with 25% Syrah, 14% Petit Verdot and just 1% Cabernet Franc. Released almost a full year later than the other Long Shadows reds, it is well-integrated and focused, with high-toned black cherry fruit set in dusty tannins. Scents of sandalwood drift through, along with cocoa and spice. As good or even better than the outstanding 2006.",93
Paul Gregutt,Dunham 2008 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A delicious Syrah in the classic mold of Columbia Valley fruit. Solid and sappy, it's a mouthful of bright berry flavors, penetrating into layers of licorice, coffee and chocolate. The liquorous finish is rich and balanced, with a hint of heat.",93
,Patz & Hall 2009 Hyde Vineyard Chardonnay (Carneros),"The reason why this winery scores so well, year after year, in Chardonnay is because the production team knows how to get maximum ripeness out of the grapes, while maintaining an integrity of structure. The '09 Hyde exhibits this quality. It's fantastically rich in oranges, apricots, pears and pineapples, yet possesses a bracing minerality and fine Carneros acidity.",93
Roger Voss,Quinta de Foz de Arouce 2007 Vinhas Velhas de Santa Maria Baga (Beiras),"A rich wine, full of dark plums, big and dusty tannins and a powerful core of dryness. The wood aging has brought out mint as well as spice, smoothing the rough edges to give an impressive and elegant finish. Keep for 4–5 years.",93
,Tenuta Monteti 2004 Monteti Red (Toscana),"This massive super Tuscan blend based mostly on Petit Verdot and Cabernet Sauvignon is thick, inky dark in color and particularly intense this vintage. Black cherry, spice, plum cake and leather are protagonists of the bouquet. The mouthfeel is smooth and incredibly rich.",93
Joe Czerwinski,Henry's Drive Vignerons 2008 Reserve Shiraz (Padthaway),"Big, bold and structured, this is a dry yet mouthwatering beast of a Shiraz, its blackberry, mocha and black olive notes held in check by firm tannins. Give it 3–4 years in the cellar, then drink it over the next several years.",93
,Volker Eisele Family Estate 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A distinguished, impressive Cabernet, obviously the result of fine grapegrowing and meticulous berry selection. It's bone dry, rich in tannins and firm, with mineral-infused blackberry and black currant flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. Will develop bottle complexity for a good eight years.",93
Paul Gregutt,Angel Vine 2009 The Hellion Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"An outstanding Hellion, 44% Primitivo, 31% Petite Sirah and 25% Zinfandel. It's a complete wine, with a full array of superbly rich berry fruits, a hint of chocolate and fine-grained tannins. Delicious right out of the bottle, but it could be cellared for at least another five years.",93
Roger Voss,La Chablisienne 2005 Les Vénérables  (Chablis),"From old vines, at least 50 years old, this shows good concentration, giving a dense, ripe, rounded wine full of green apple fruits, hints of vanilla and streaks of minerality.",89
Joe Czerwinski,Lake Breeze 2003 Follett Family Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Langhorne Creek),"A product of a hot, short growing season, Lake Folly's 2003 Cabernet Sauvignon shows some slightly overripe notes of cola and prune, but also features a high degree of richness allied to a broad, mouthfilling texture. It lacks nuance, but it is a big, flavorful mouthful that ends with hints of coffee and chocolate. Drink now–2010.",89
Joe Czerwinski,Longview 2006 Devils Elbow Single Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Adelaide Hills),"Softer and more approachable than the winery's powerful 2005, this wine offers lush plum, leather and loam notes, accented by a touch of cracked pepper. It's full-bodied and creamy-textured, with a soft finish that invites another sip. Drink now–2012.",89
,Villa Matilde 2003 Red (Falerno del Massico),"Aglianico and Piedirosso grapes are blended to produce a thick and broad wine with an inky black color and notes of very ripe red fruit. It has a sweet, chewy aspect with vibrant, albeit densely extracted fruit and soaring tannins. Try it with a beef stew or similarly heavy dishes.",89
,Williams Selyem 2005 Hawk Hill Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"This hugely ripe Chardonnay is just a little too big for absolute balance. Any more powerful, and it would be over the line. As it is, it flirts with it, with gobs of jammy apricots, yellow pears, citrine and Meyer lemondrop, as well as barrel influences ranging from creamy lees to buttered toast, roasted hazelnuts and smoky honey. The alcohol is over 15%.",89
Joe Czerwinski,Craneford 2005 Allyson Parsons Cabernet Sauvignon (Barossa Valley),"Sourced largely from the northern end of the region, this features bold blackberry flavors slightly reminiscent of preserves and marked by dark shadings of cola and chocolate. Yet despite the superripe flavors, the wine remains well structured and retains some slightly herbal overtones. Drink now–2012.",89
,Feudi di San Gregorio 2005  Greco di Tufo,"Feudi di San Gregorio's distinctive take on the indigenous Greco variety favors a more saturated and concentrated style. The color  is slightly more golden and intense and the aromas reveal ripe melon, honey, dried hay and almond.",89
Paul Gregutt,Ponzi 2005 Reserve Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"This is a high acid style of Chardonnay, reflective of a vintage that was one of the coolest in a decade or more. Crisp and detailed, this offers a classy mix of citrus and apple, wet stone and light baking spices. Hints of nutmeg and cinnamon adorn the fruit, which lingers gently through a citrusy finish.",89
Joe Czerwinski,Razor's Edge 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (McLaren Vale),"A very good effort, this may be among the last great values to emerge from Australia, as smaller crops and changing currencies will undoubtedly take their toll. It's remarkable that McLaren Vale fruit can go into a $12 bottle. Black cherry fruit is presented on a medium-bodied, softly tannic frame, embellished by hints of cola and eucalyptus. Finishes soft, with a fine texture of charcoal dust and lingering cassis flavors.",89
Michael Schachner,Torres 2003 Reserva Real Red (Penedès),"Plenty of new oak is announced via aromas of coconut, mint, vanilla and burnt toast. but offsetting that is lively berry and cola flavors. As it opens and settles in, you get a wall of fierce tannins that aren't likely to fade any time soon. So unless you have years to cellar this wine, it will likely hold onto its hard, tannic personality. Hold another three years, if possible.",89
Michael Schachner,Carlos Basso 2006 Dos Fincas Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Uco Valley),"Blackberry and cassis aromas share the bouquet with tougher, more masculine notes of earth, rubber and char. Once it opens on the palate, there's ripe raspberry, plum and a nod to the black side of the fruit spectrum. Finishes with a mild kick of tannins and the essence of coffee and pepper. A solid blend of Cabernet and Merlot from the improving Uco Valley.",89
Paul Gregutt,Daedalus 2006 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"Complex mixed stone fruits dappled with sweet cinnamon spice lead into a fairly lush midpalate. The dominant flavor is fresh cut pear, and the creamy texture spreads the flavors broadly through the mouth. A lovely wine to match with halibut or swordfish.",89
Roger Voss,La Chablisienne 2005 Côte de Léchet Premier Cru  (Chablis),"This is a cool cru, which shows even in this great year with its structure, austerity and steely character. It makes it old-style Chablis, with its green fruits and lively, poised freshness.",89
Michael Schachner,Piattelli 2005 Premium Malbec (Luján de Cuyo),"Black plum, cola and chocolate define this textbook Malbec. The wine has body, heft and lots of fruit, but also some complexity and character. Flavors of black cherry, plum and cassis are layered and fairly boisterous, while the mouthfeel is firm and just slightly tannic. Just right for red meats and pastas.",89
Joe Czerwinski,Strathewen Hills 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Yarra Valley),"A crisp medium-bodied Cab with good varietal definition, Strathewen Hill's 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon boasts slightly minty cassis-inflected fruit, vanilla and chocolate notes and a smooth mouthfeel. Supple tannins on the finish suggest this will age well through 2012 or so.",89
,Di Meo 2003 Alessandra  (Fiano di Avellino),"This boasts brilliant clarity, purity and aromas of orange blossom, pear, melon and peach. It's a tad flatter and creamier than other renditions of this native grape but nonetheless would make an idea match to fish, pasta salad or most chicken dishes.",89
,Hendry 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Hendry has a good track record with Cabernet, and although this isn't their best effort, it's an interesting, moderately ageworthy wine. It's pretty tough in tannins right now, but the astringency frames ripe blackberry and cassis flavors that linger in the finish. Needs time. Best 2008–2010.",89
Michael Schachner,Ànima Negra 2004 Àn Red (Vi de la Terra Illes Balears),"Overall this Callet-led blend might exceed its more oaked, richer brother known as Son Negre. Àn has a rooty, oak-driven nose with hints of herbs and tobacco, while the palate is dark and tasty, with blackberry, cherry and cured meat flavors. Finishes with pepper and a lash of leftover oak that hopefully will disappear as the wine ages. Drink now through 2012.",89
,Botromagno 2001 Gravisano Passito Malvasia Bianca (Murgia),"Apricot, peach cobbler, sticky honey, white flower and macadamia nut color a seductively sweet wine from Puglia, the heel of the Italian “boot.” Thanks to strong sunshine and cooling breezes, Malvasia grapes lose their water mass, resulting in rich concentration and intense fragrances.",89
Joe Czerwinski,Nugan Family Estates 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (South Eastern Australia),"A soft, medium-bodied wine that tends toward bright, red-berried fruit, this is a solid everyday Cabernet. Cedar and tobacco-leaf notes accent the cherry-berry fruit, while hints of vanilla and caramel linger elegantly on the finish. Drink now.",88
Joe Czerwinski,Shingleback 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (McLaren Vale),"A real crowd-pleaser, the 2005 Shingleback may not have quite the complexity of the 2004, but it's still a fun, approachable wine. Cola and coffee notes accent plum and blackberry flavors, while the broad texture coats the mouth with soft tannins. Drink now–2012.",88
,Alexander Valley Vineyards 2006 Wetzel Family Estate Chardonnay (Alexander Valley),"For such a large production Chard, this one gives a lot of concentrated varietal purity. It's dry and crisp, brimming with ripe pineapple, green apple, Key lime pie, pear, date and smoky vanilla flavors that finish with real sophistication and class.",88
,Summerwood 2012 Grenache Blanc (Paso Robles),"A nice interpretation of Grenache Blanc. Blended with a drop of Viognier, it shows notes of orange and peach jam, honey, vanilla and toasty oak. The alcohol level is high. Drink up.",87
Roger Voss,Steininger 2010 Sekt Pinot Noir (Österreichischer Sekt),"For lovers of red sparkling wine with its attendant tannins, this is a fine example. It has a definite Pinot Noir farmyard character along with tannins, a touch of smokiness, and a definite need for food.",87
Paul Gregutt,AntoLin Cellars 2011 Estate Riesling (Yakima Valley),"There is a creamy, leesy mouthfeel to this estate-grown Riesling, whose residual sugar is masked with acidity. Tart apple and pear fruit flavors finish with lighter notes of candied orange and citrus.",87
,Calicaro 2010 Les Fauves White Hawk Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara),"Good and dry, with tough tannins that make it hard to drink now. With blackberry, currant, molasses and dark chocolate flavors, it seems like an ager, but may not have the concentration for the long haul. Try again in 2–3 years.",87
Michael Schachner,Caliterra 2010 Tribute Edicion Limitada Syrah-Cabernet Sauvignon-Viognier Red (Colchagua Valley),"Crusty aromas of black fruits mesh nicely with lemon peel and floral scents. The acidity here is noticeably high, which creates a scouring mouthfeel. Short flavors of berry and cassis are shrill, while the body and cushion offered by this blend of Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Viognier are modest at best.",87
Michael Schachner,Emiliana 2011 Novas Gran Reserva Made with Organically Grown Grapes Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley),"Rubbery red-berry aromas blend with spicy field scents to create a true Pinot nose that's a bit strained. This is intense, chunky and slightly herbal, with red-fruit flavors, spice notes and some heat and oak on the finish.",87
Michael Schachner,Errazuriz 2012 Max Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Aconcagua Valley),"Hay, straw, match stick and minerally aromas outweigh this wine's fruit scents by a measurable margin. This is chunky and a bit soft in the mouth, a reflection of 2012's heat. And while it's round as a ball, it's slightly vegetal and bitter tasting on the palate, with grapefruit and bell pepper flavors.",87
Roger Voss,Château Belrose 2011  Bordeaux,"This solid, structured wine has black currant fruit, balanced acidity and firm tannins. The wine has a solid texture, a core of dryness and the potential to age 3–4 years.",87
Roger Voss,Château de Lestiac 2011  Cadillac Côtes de Bordeaux,"Under the serious amount of wood, this wine feels rich and concentrated. Wood spice, a touch burnt, along with chocolate and black currant fruit show both extraction and the need for 2–3 years' aging.",87
Roger Voss,Château les Mottes Pradier 2011  Côtes de Bourg,"Solid and tannic, very firm from the opening to the finish. It is based around a dark core of wood and spice as well as more juicy fruit flavors. The wine needs time to round out and bring more of the juiciness to the fore.",87
Sean P. Sullivan,Cor Cellars 2011 E Cor Si Move Tempranillo 24K Vineyard Tempranillo (Wahluke Slope),This is a rare beast from Washington—single vineyard Tempranillo aged in neutral oak coming in at less than 13% alcohol. It's soft and light with notes of red fruit and refreshing acidity that drops off on the back half.,87
Roger Voss,Domäne Wachau 2012 Terrassen Gelber Muskateller (Wachau),"Grape and spice aromas give this wine a distinctive heady perfume. A rare style to find in the Wachau, it brings a fine balance between fruit and perfume with the textured nature of Wachau wines. Ready to drink, or age for a year. Screwcap.",87
,Happy Canyon Vineyard 2010 Piocho Red (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),"Easy to drink this blend of all five classic Bordeaux varieties, with Merlot predominating. It's all about cherries, blackberries, plum jam, currants and chocolate. Not particularly subtle or ageworthy, but very pretty.",87
Michael Schachner,Viña Bisquertt 2011 La Joya Gran Reserva Merlot (Colchagua Valley),"This opens with a good mix of tobacco, black cherry, cola and mocha aromas. In the mouth, this offers good body, size and balance along with lightly herbal, leafy flavors of mossy black fruits. A mellow finish with a solid structure is a welcome ending.",87
Kerin O’Keefe,Virna Borgogno 2009 Cannubi Boschis  (Barolo),"This opens with evident oak aromas of toasted wood, espresso and coffee bean followed by underpinnings of black fruit and pepper. The palate shows ripe black fruit, espresso and oak. Although it has nice depth, the finish is cut short by by drying wood tannins.",87
Paul Gregutt,Walla Walla Vintners 2010 Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This is a tough, chewy Merlot, a bit of a stylistic departure for Walla Walla Vintners. Perhaps it's the addition of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, or perhaps just the result of the challenging 2010 vintage in the Walla Walla Valley. But the greenish tannins bring a lot of herbal flavors to the forefront, and tend to bury the fruit.",87
Roger Voss,Pezat 2011  Bordeaux Supérieur,"Dense planting for this vineyard has resulted in a wine that has greater concentration than in the past. The wine has firm tannins, while showing already delicious black-currant fruit. For drinking over the next 2–4 years.",87
Kerin O’Keefe,Pico Maccario 2011 Tre Rovere  (Barbera d'Asti Superiore),"This is a pretty, well-made Barbera with an invitingly floral and fruity bouquet. The palate shows ripe black-fruit flavors accompanied by touches of spice, coffee and chocolate. This would be perfect with grilled meats.",87
,Robert Mondavi 2011 Private Selection Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Coast),"Mondavi's done it again, produced another very nice Cabernet at an everyday price. It shows classy elegance, with blackberry, currant and mocha notes.",87
Joe Czerwinski,Robert Oatley 2011 Finisterre Chardonnay (Margaret River),"This is a soft, appealing Chardonnay layered with toasted marshmallow and superripe peach. It's round in the mouth and lushly textured, then turns citrusy—almost metallic—on the finish.",87
Lauren Buzzeo,Shvo 2010 Chenin Blanc (Upper Galilee),"Here's a refreshing and attractive Chenin Blanc that offers clean notes of ripe pear, green apple and honewdew melon alongside accents of cinnamon and white florals. The palate is light weight and vibrant, with lifting acidity that adds zest to the medium-length finish.",87
Kerin O’Keefe,Stroppiana 2008 Vigna San Giacomo  (Barolo),"Fruit and spice aromas show dark cherry, white pepper and toasted oak aromas of espresso and chocolate, with a hint of orange peel. The palate has fresh strawberry, coffee and citrusy notes but not much depth.",87
Roger Voss,Château Grand Billard 2011  Bordeaux,"Fine, rich black-fruit flavors give this wine a sense of ripeness, openness and generosity. The wood and fruit balance is already fine, showing that it will be ready to drink this year.",87
Joe Czerwinski,Mitolo 2009 Reiver Shiraz (Barossa Valley),"Mint marks the nose of this otherwise darkly attractive wine. Notes of mocha and plum nicely set up the wine, as do the supple tannins, but then there's a jarring edge of prickly acidity that cuts across the palate and disrupts the flow. There are some nice parts here that don't quite come together.",87
Michael Schachner,Anakena 2011 Ona Special Reserve Pinot Noir (Leyda Valley),"Tea, tomato, raspberry and spice aromas are typical for Leyda Pinot. The body is a bit light and hollow, but that also means it's not heavy. Raspberry and spiced tea flavors control the palate, while plum, spice and light herb flavors work the almost dilute finish.",87
,Cade 2009 Napa Cuvée Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"With a bit of Merlot, Petit Verdot and Malbec, this Cab is marked by hard tannins and blackberry and cherry jam, black currant and oak flavors. The finish is gripping, however, it's pretty tart, and you have to wonder if that sharpness will ever age out. Decant and drink up.",87
Michael Schachner,Caliterra 2010 Tribute Edicion Limitada Cabernet Franc-Petit Verdot Red (Colchagua Valley),"This blend of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot opens with fiery, oaky aromas that include cherry, cassis and vanilla. The palate has a severe tartaric shear to it along with clampy tannins. High-toned flavors of raspberry and plum are propped up by blazing acidity, while the finish is herbal and peppery in taste, with a scouring feel.",87
Michael Schachner,Casa Rivas 2010 Gran Reserva Syrah (Maipo Valley),"A green, minty wave of challenging aromas comes with black olive, coconutty oak and graphite. The palate is bullish, scratchy in feel and tannic, with feral, herbal flavors of blackberry, juniper and wild herbs. Herbal and wild are the best words to describe this Syrah.",87
Sean P. Sullivan,Waterbrook 2011 Reserve Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Aged in 68% new French oak, the barrel notes take center stage here with aromas of toast and spice. The palate is creamy and full with a viscous feel, tapering in concentration toward the finish.",87
Roger Voss,Château Macquin 2011  Saint-Georges-Saint-Émilion,"Ripe fruit, sweet tannins and soft texture mark this wine. It's full, ripe and lightly structured. An attractive wine for its black fruit and forward character. Drink in 2–4 years.",87
Roger Voss,Domäne Wachau 2012 Terrassen Federspiel Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),"Fruity wine, light, elegant with a touch of minerality, it shows a fine balance of green fruits and its spice. The wine is all about freshness, crispness, a touch of minerality to give texture. At the end, the fragrant acidity shines. Screwcap.",87
Paul Gregutt,Hawks View 2010 Merlot (Washington),"It's not easy to get 16.5% alcohol from a vintage as cool as 2010 in Washington. The wine has a grain and grass bouquet, wild and brambly fruit, and plenty of Asian spices. Interesting, though not especially typical for the grape variety",87
,Chime 2012 Chardonnay (Oakville),"Not the richest Chardonnay ever, but it has complex notes of citrus, apple, nectarine and tropical fruits, with kisses of vanilla and cream. Acidity gives it elegant brightness.",87
Roger Voss,Clos Troteligotte 2011 K-nom Malbec-Merlot (Cahors),"Great value, simple and fruity, this is a ripe wine without wood aging, just bursting with black fruit flavors. It's rich, slightly stalky and ready to drink now.",87
,Coghlan 2010 Coghlan Estate Vineyard Block 2 Diamond Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Ynez Valley),"This is an enormously rich Cabernet. It explodes in milk chocolate, black cherry, spicy plum and sweet, toasty oak flavors, wrapped into smooth tannins. Delicious, if a bit one-dimensional. Drink now.",87
,Collier Falls 2010 Hillside Estate Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Made in a richer, riper style, this Zin brims with flavors of raspberries, cherries, red currants and brown sugar, like a Christmas fruitcake. The alcohol is quite high. Drink soon.",87
Paul Gregutt,Dumas Station 2010 Cow Catcher Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This is a fine, all-purpose red blend, mostly Cabernet, with time in one-third new French and American oak. Heavily charred, smoky and earthy, it's got a fair amount of dark cassis fruit to carry all the barrel toast and finishes with some notes of bark and stem.",87
,Laetitia 2011 Clone 113 Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley),"Lots of early-drinking charm in this Pinot Noir. It's light and silky, with a modest alcohol level that makes it easy to drink. The raspberry, cherry, cola and oak flavors are delicious.",86
Michael Schachner,Mancura 2011 Guardián Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),"Scratchy berry aromas come with a hint of sweet-smelling plastic, but overall this bargain-priced Cab is good and welcoming. The palate has a pure, medium-bodied feel, while flavors of baked berry, cassis and chocolate finish with a mocha taste and mild heat.",86
Paul Gregutt,O•S Winery 2009 Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This Bordeaux-style blend remains a fair value, showing some sweet barrel spices along with opening fruit flavors of red and black berry. It thins out in the middle and finishes with a simple, fruity flourish.",86
Roger Voss,Pezat 2012  Bordeaux Blanc,"A cool, very Sauvignon wine, with strong herbaceous and citrus flavors. It's crisp, showing a bright, tight, slightly mineral texture.",86
,Purlieu 2012 Le Pich Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"There's a honeyed note to this wine, yet it's crisp in acidity, giving it a mouthwatering savoriness for drinking now. The flavors veer toward Asian pears, peaches and tart gooseberries.",86
Paul Gregutt,SuLei 2010 Les Collines Vineyard Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Though this is pure Cabernet from an excellent Walla Walla vineyard, the flavors seem rather harsh and quite astringent. The dark fruit is cloaked in bitter, chalky tannins that require some rich food to cut through.",86
Michael Schachner,Valle Secreto 2010 First Edition Cabernet Sauvignon (Cachapoal Valley),"On the nose, this Cab delivers a mix of vinegar, rubber and jumpy berry aromas. The palate is smooth but bland and soft, while flavors of licorice, prune and herbal notes finish easy.",86
Lauren Buzzeo,Binyamina 2010 Yogev Cabernet Sauvignon (Galilee),"Yogev, meaning “tiller of the soil,” is a friendly and easy-pleasing wine, with direct notes of cherry skins, fresh cassis and black currant leaf. Medium weight, with moderate acidity, fine tannins and a clean, fruit-driven finish. Drink now.",86
,Wild Horse 2011 Unbridled Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),"This Chard's oak accents pineapple and lemon fruit flavors. It's dry yet honeyed, that paradox of Chardonnay, with a good burst of citrusy acids for brightness.",86
Roger Voss,Robert Perroud 2011 L'Enfer des Balloquets  (Brouilly),"Bold and fruity, this is laden with bitter cherry and juicy plum flavors. The tannins are light and attractive, with juicy, refreshing acidity. Age this for a few more months.",88
,Stephanie 2008 Merlot (Napa Valley),"Rich and dense, this has blackberry and black cherry jam, mocha and spice flavors. It contains 16% Cabernet Sauvignon, which lends the wine weight and body. While it's technically dry, there's a sweetness that comes from the ripeness of fruit and the caramel flavor from the oak, which gives it a sugary, bacony taste. Delicious now and for a few years.",88
,Tarara 2010 Nevaeh White (Virginia),"Rich, exotic notes of honey-glazed papaya and warm pear are accented by touches of white flower, graham cracker and lemon custard. The palate feels round and weighty, with flavors that aren't as effusive as one might expect. Acids provide enough spine to keep the palate from drooping, with hints of clove and lemongrass adding interest. A blend of 55% Chardonnay, 45% Viognier.",88
,Tenute Soletta 2011 Chimera  (Vermentino di Sardegna),"Fresh and clean, this Vermentino offers ripe aromas of apricot and peach, with background tones of citrus and pear. It's extra smooth and silky on the close.",88
,Tenute Soletta 2011 Kyanos White (Isola dei Nuraghi),"This blend of Incrocio Manzoni and Vermentino opens with bold floral intensity, plus solid background tones of peach and lemon mousse. It offers a creamy, soft mouthfeel that could stand up to white meat or shellfish.",88
,The Gardener 2011 Pinot Noir (Carneros),"This has acidity and tannins that are rich and complex. The raspberry, cola and licorice flavors have a nice coating of smoky oak.",88
,Turnbull 2009 Leopoldina Cabernet Franc (Oakville),"This is dry, full bodied and pretty tannic, with a sense of elegance, plus flavors of sour cherry candy, red licorice, tobacco and sweet, smoky cedar.",88
Roger Voss,Vignerons de Bel Air 2011 Domaine de la Source  (Chiroubles),"This has a firmly tannic structure and juicy fruit, suggesting its aging potential. It is rich and ripe, with black cherry and plum flavors that create a generous finish.",88
Michael Schachner,Laroche 2010 Viña Punto Alto Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley),"The light-framed aromas of strawberry and raspberry are clean and citrusy. The palate on this wine made by the Chablis-based producer Laroche is crisp, tangy and juicy, with flavors of raspberry and cranberry that are fresh and tight. A clean, honest Pinot to enjoy now.",88
Paul Gregutt,Youngberg Hill Vineyards 2009 Natasha Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Sporting a much-improved label design, the 2009 Natasha brings pungent, assertive scents of tomato leaf, pepper and moist earth. Sharp and focused, the fruit is there, though it's the leaf and earth components that stand out. For its earthy style, it's a well-made and complex offering.",88
,Torre Quarto 2007 Regale  (Primitivo di Manduria),"This is a savory, elegant, concentrated effort that doesn't show too much sweetness. Dark fruit, spice, black olive and tobacco notes appear on the silky close.",88
Roger Voss,Château de Bordes-Quancard 2010  Bordeaux,"Cherry and blackberry notes dominate this ripe, full wine. It has a smoky, toasty character that lends good balance and aging potential. The estate is planted with Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon.",88
Roger Voss,Château de Panigon 2010  Médoc,"Tough tannins set the scene for this firm and extracted wine, giving it a smokiness and a touch of bitter fruit. However, the wine has the weight to support the tannins, and it hints at future juicy fruit. Keep this for at least five years.",88
Roger Voss,Château de Raousset 2011  Chiroubles,"Showing a mineral-driven structure and firm tannins, this is a Beaujolais that needs to age. Rich and juicy, its perfumed red fruits currently cut through the dry tannins.",88
Roger Voss,Château Tour des Gendres 2011 Cuvée des Contis White (Bergerac Sec),"This is full of crisp, herbaceous flavors of apple, grapefruit and lime. It has weight and concentration, with some richness to its freshness. Acidity cuts through on the finish. Age this for 2–3 years.",88
,Cottanera 2011 Barbazzale  (Etna),"Made from Nerello Mascalese and Nerello Cappuccio, this shows bright berry aromas of blackberry and cassis, with cola, dried ginger and polished mineral notes. The mouthfeel is clean and bright, with a touch of chopped mint.",88
Paul Gregutt,Cowhorn 2011 Marsanne-Roussanne (Applegate Valley),"At just 12.6% alcohol, this might seem underripe for warm climate varieties, but it tastes perfectly full and nicely balanced. It's tart and lemony, to be sure, and in fact makes a fine accompaniment to fresh-shucked oysters.",88
Paul Gregutt,Erath 2010 Prince Hill Pommard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"This is the most complete of the four Prince Hill clonal selection bottlings. It has flavors of cherry, Dr. Pepper, cherry candy and a hint of incense. It's a pleasant, easy-drinking wine best consumed while still young.",88
,Feudi di San Marzano 2010 Sud  (Primitivo di Manduria),"Fleshy, bold and well concentrated, this Primitivo di Manduria delivers sweet fruit flavors of blackberry pie, prune and raspberry jelly. The wine is soft and chewy, with a bright note of fruity sweetness on the finish.",88
Roger Voss,Georges Vigouroux 2010 Château de Mercuès Le Vassal de Mercuès Malbec (Cahors),"This is the second wine of Château de Mercuès, and it has some of the same concentration and tannins as the first wine, without the huge and powerful structure. It will develop its black cherry and spice flavors relatively quickly, to yield a ready-to-drink wine in 2–3 years.",88
,Leone de Castris 2010 Elo Veni Negroamaro (Salento),"This offers ripe cherry and blackberry notes, followed by bright acidity and a palate that bears medium density. It's a great food wine to pair with breaded veal, sausage or meatloaf.",88
,Mastroberardino 2011  Greco di Tufo,"This gorgeous Greco di Tufo opens with bright aromas of pear, peach and crushed brimstone. In the mouth, it tastes fresh and fruity. Pair it with crab cakes or Thai vegetable rolls.",88
,Pessagno 2010 Intrinity Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),"This best-of-barrels Chardonnay is oaky, offering waves of butterscotch and buttered toast that dominate the tart underlying flavors of pineapple and lime. It's certainly rich and well-structured, but quite oaky.",88
,Pessagno 2010 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Soft, sweet and appealing, this has raspberry and cherry jam flavors, with an oak-influenced note of buttered toast. It's an easy, gentle wine, with some real depth and complexity.",88
,Planeta 2010 Plumbago Nero d'Avola (Sicilia),"Plumbago is a pure expression of Nero d'Avola that portrays the natural characteristics of this indigenous Sicilian grape. Red berry, cherry, almond skin and pistachio open the bouquet and give way to zesty freshness on the palate.",88
,Potomac Point 2010 Richland Reserve Chardonnay (Virginia),"This smells deep and bass-like, with resonating notes of honeyed white currant, spiced breakfast toast and apricot preserves, accented with touches of caramel and toasted nut. It feels round, rich and opulent, with a nice lift of acids that give the wine some spring.",88
,Principi di Spadafora 2007 Schietto Syrah (Sicilia),"This Syrah offers bright tones of leather, cured meat and blackberry. Smooth and long-lasting, the palate boasts loads of bright berries.",88

,Robert Hall 2011 Rhône de Robles Red (Paso Robles),"A blend of Grenache, Syrah, Cinsault and Counoise, this is bone dry and brisk in acidity, with complex flavors of mineral, herb, sour cherry candy, red currant and white pepper. Although production was only 2,000 cases, this wine is worth the search.",88
Roger Voss,Signé Vigneron 2011 Domaine de l'Oseraie  (Morgon),"For a Morgon, this is relatively light, showing more fruit than structure, with freshness that's tempered by a firm edge and minerality. Keep for a year, or drink now.",88
Michael Schachner,Felix Solis 2013 Flirty Bird Syrah (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),"Berry and cherry aromas are surprisingly sturdy and clean. Freshness is maintained on the palate, which is honest enough to offer modest tannic bite. Lightly spiced plum and raspberry flavors change little on an easy finish.",85
Michael Schachner,Marionette 2012 Monastrell-Syrah (Jumilla),"Gritty aromas of stewed berry, lemony oak, green herbs and tin set up a tannic, chewy, highly extracted palate that's lacking in elegance. Flavors of chocolate, green herbs, blueberry, vanilla and plastic finish oaky and creamy, with lasting heat.",85
Paul Gregutt,Wildewood 2013 Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"This is serviceable but rather bland, with a dusting of cinnamon spice and simple, tart fruit.",85
Roger Voss,Wunsch & Mann 2012 Roi Clovis Riesling (Alsace),"A lightly fruity wine that has a soft texture, gentle acidity and a perfumed aftertaste. It is ready to drink with its steely backbone well enmeshed in the fruitiness.",85
Michael Schachner,Ricominciare 2010 Malbec-Tannat (Uco Valley),"Initial plum and berry aromas fall off with airing and reveal notes of chemical and chewing gum dust. On the palate, this blend of 60% Malbec and 40% Tannat is chewy, sticky and flat. Modest but sweet berry flavors veer toward molasses prior to finishing without much acidity or verve.",84
Michael Schachner,Ricominciare 2011 Malbec-Cabernet Franc (Uco Valley),"Aromas of latex, plastic, clove and wild berry fruits try to come together. A hard, high-acid palate is narrow and choppy, with biting tannins, while a salty flavor profile that includes blackberry finishes woody and savory, with a lasting taste of clove.",84
Michael Schachner,Rutini 2012 Trumpeter Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),"Gritty, roasted berry aromas are rubbery and hint at Band-Aids. In the mouth, this is O.K. in feel, albeit a bit jammy and thick. Short, generic berry flavors come with minty accents and some green on the finish.",84
Alexander Peartree,Chatham 2012 Church Creek Oak Chardonnay (Virginia's Eastern Shore),"Lemon curd and artificial butter show on the nose and palate, with underripe peach adding verve to a creamy body.",84
Virginie Boone,McIlroy 2013 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"This full-throttle, oaky Chardonnay features an intriguingly curious mix of corn nuts, diesel and marijuana on the nose. The corresponding layers of flavor are straightforward and simple.",84
Paul Gregutt,Wildewood 2013 Guadalupe Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Despite its single-vineyard designation, this watery effort could be from anywhere. Thin, dilute, barely ripe strawberry fruit vanishes quickly once in the mouth, and there is little trace of any barrel flavors from aging in 20% new French oak.",84
Kerin O’Keefe,Vino dei Fratelli 2013 Nero d'Avola (Terre Siciliane),Fruity aromas that recall blueberry and pomegranate carry over to the lean palate along with brisk acidity.,84

Roger Voss,Cave de Kientzheim-Kaysersberg 2013 Anne de K Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"This wine has a light, fresh character to go with the ripe spiced fruits. It's smooth with a tangy lime-zest flavor filled out with yellow fruits. Drink now.",84
Kerin O’Keefe,Feudi del Pisciotto 2013 Baglio del Sole Inzolia (Sicilia),The nose isn't very expressive but reveals white flower and tropical fruit. The simple palate delivers pineapple and lemon zest alongside brisk acidity.,84
Michael Schachner,Mureda 2012 Oak Aged Syrah (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),"Dusty aromas of red cherry are muddled by oaky notes of plastic and latex. A jumpy, bright palate is rudimentary, as are lightly spiced plum and raspberry flavors. A fresh, dry, basic finish seems appropriate.",84
Michael Schachner,San Felipe 2012 Oak Cask Estate Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),"Dry, spicy aromas aren't overly ripe or expressive. In the mouth, this basic Cab is raw, racy and spiky in feel. Flavors of herbal red-berry fruits are leafy, while finishing flavors of carob and pepper register as adequate.",84
Roger Voss,Vieil Armand 2013 Tradition Pinot Blanc (Alsace),"Soft, floral and fruity, this is a rounded wine with a gentle texture, yellow fruits and light acidity. There is a good touch of spice to fill the wine out right at the end.",84
Paul Gregutt,Wine by Joe 2013 Pinot Noir (Oregon),"Underripe fruit seems more sour than anything. Some bitter, stemmy flavors creep into the finish.",84
Roger Voss,Wine with Spirit NV Basta Brut Rosé Sparkling (Vinho Espumante),"This wine looks and tastes bright pink. It is creamy, not quite dry and soft, although the aftertaste shows some fresh acidity. Crushed strawberry flavors suggest that it will pair well with fruit salad.",84
Roger Voss,Wines & Winemakers 2014 Azul Portugal Rosé (Península de Setúbal),"Made from Castelão, the local grape of the Setúbal region, this wine is as bright and clean as possible. The light texture makes it ideal for summer drinking.",84
Roger Voss,Wunsch & Mann 2013 Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"The style is all perfume, recalling straightforward lychee and spice wine. It has a rounded texture, soft and medium sweet, and is ready to be enjoyed.",84
Jim Gordon,Murphy-Goode 2012 HomeFront Red (California),"This is soft and easy in texture, light in flavors and slightly sweet. Light to medium bodied, it has very little tannin or astringency, is low in acidity and quiet on the finish.",84
Roger Voss,Pierre Sparr 2013 Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"This is light, fruity and fresh for a Gewurztraminer. A crisp character brings out bitter orange and ripe pear flavors. Drink now.",84
Roger Voss,Rieflé 2013 Bonheur Convivial Gewurztraminer (Alsace),There's no mistaking the grape in this spiced and peppery wine. Candy-shop aromas and bergamot flavors go together with a light acidity to create a wine that's drinkable now.,84
Matt Kettmann,Sands Point 2012 Pinot Noir (Central Coast),"Amid the blackberry and asphalt tones, this has a funky rubber twist on the nose. The bottling is a side label of Avelina, founded by former Oreana Winery owner Christian Garvin. It's tart and sour on the palate, with dried raspberries and a bit more funk.",84
Michael Schachner,Árido 2013 Sustainably Farmed Moscato (Mendoza),"Dusty aromas of balloon rubber and apple juice are sketchy, but in the mouth this is fair and balanced. Flavors of lychee, mango candy and sweet papaya finish soft and lightly oxidized.",84
Roger Voss,Arthur Metz 2013 Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"This wine is all about perfumes and spice. It's ripe, fruity and already drinkable. Bergamot and fruity candy dominate the light acidity and soft texture.",84
Michael Schachner,Casa Rojo 2013 El Gordo del Circo Verdejo (Rueda),Melon and citrus aromas are yeasty and a bit sulfuric. This feels plump and juicy but not exact or well cut. Flavors of briny apple and nectarine turn bitter and salty on the finish.,84
Roger Voss,Cave de Cleebourg 2013 Prestige Pinot Gris (Alsace),"This wine is soft, rounded and smooth. With just enough acidity to give a fresh character, it is ripe with pear and quince flavors. It's ready to drink, light and fragrant.",84
Roger Voss,Jean-Marc Bernhard 2013 Cuvée Particulière Pinot Gris (Alsace),"Produced from a number of parcels around the village of Katzenthal, this is a fresh and fruity wine, easy to drink. It's bright with acidity, flavored with ripe quince and apple fruits. It's ready to drink.",84
Roger Voss,Fiuza 2013 3 Castas White (Tejo),"This attractive blend of Chardonnay, Arinto and Vital is fresh, fruity, packed with apple and lemon flavors and totally ready to drink. There's a great line in acidity, a crisp texture and a green, lively aftertaste.",87
,Rock Wall 2012 Super Alamedan Red (California),"Made from Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Zinfandel, this is one of Rock Wall's drier, lower-alcohol wines. It's high in acidity, with a silky mouthfeel. A little rustic, it shows cherry skin, tobacco and white pepper flavors.",87

,Santa Barbara Winery 2010 Petite Sirah (Santa Barbara County),"It's a midnight-black wine, full-bodied and tannic, with immense black currant, grilled meat and black pepper flavors that finish bone dry.

Sean P. Sullivan,Schmidt 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Applegate Valley),"Coming from the cool 2010 vintage, this 100% varietal wine doesn't quite seem to have fully ripened but still offers plenty of enjoyment with its savory notes of leafy herbs, olive and cherry. It's elegant in its styling with a fresh feel and a cinnamon-speckled finish.",87
Kerin O’Keefe,Selva Capuzza 2012 San Vigilio  (Lugana),"This vibrant wine begins with aromas of apples, stone fruit and mineral. The savory palate offers ripe Bartlett pear, citrus and peach alongside bright acidity. It closes on a bitter almond note.",87
Kerin O’Keefe,Tenuta Luisa 2011 Refosco (Venezia Giulia),"Spicy and savory, it offers aromas of white and black pepper along with raspberry, dark cherry and hints of bell pepper that carry over to the palate along with aggressive tannins. Drink 2015–2021.",87

Michael Schachner,Santa Alicia 2010 Anke Blend 2 Carménère-Petit Verdot-Shiraz Red (Maipo Valley),"Reedy berry aromas mixed with herbal notes set up a chunky, voluminous palate. Spicy flavors of olive, green herbs, tobacco and oak run alongside berry and plum fruit. On the finish, a resiny oak flavor and herbal notes meld then fade away. This is 55% Carmenère, 30% Petit Verdot and 15% Syrah.",87
Roger Voss,Louis Jadot 2012  Mâcon-Villages,"With touches of vanilla and caramel as well as ripe yellow fruits, this is a warm, generous Chardonnay. It has freshness from the citrus edge and a soft texture. Straightforward, it is an open and ready-to-drink wine.",87
Michael Schachner,Mancura 2010 Gran Reserva Petit Verdot-Carmère-Cabernet Sauvignon Red (Maipo Valley),"A familiar Chilean mix of berry, plum, spice and herbal aromas feed into a lifted but prickly palate that supports roasted, earthy flavors of berry, cassis and olive.

Kerin O’Keefe,Olivi 2008 Memento Red (Toscana),"A fifty-fifty blend of Sangiovese and Syrah, this densely concentrated wine has aromas that suggest underbrush, wet leaves, black berries and prune.

Roger Voss,Quinta do Casal Branco 2012 Red (Tejo),"Still young, it is full of spice from wood aging along with juicy black fruits. It is soft, dominated by black currant and acidity. Not for aging, it will be ready by the end of 2014.",87
,Rodney Strong 2010 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"Dry and tannic, this 100% Cab has flavors of herbs, blackberries and tea. It's a tough wine not showing generosity now. You can age for a couple years, but the tannins will outlast the fruit.",87

Kerin O’Keefe,Cantina del Castello 2013 Castello  (Soave Classico),"Floral aromas of white spring flowers partner hints of pear and stone fruit. The juicy palate offers white peach, apple and green melon alongside a mineral note and fresh acidity.",87
Kerin O’Keefe,Castelfeder 2012 Vom Stein Pinot Bianco (Alto Adige),"Subdued aromas recall Alpine wild flowers and lychee. The fresh, linear palate offers Golden Delicious apples and citrus notes with a hint of wax alongside crisp acidity.",87
Roger Voss,Château Magondeau 2010  Fronsac,"A dense and rich, jammy Merlot that is full of black fruit and has an ultra-ripe feel. It is hardly Bordeaux, but it does hold attraction with its rich, full fruits and dense tannins. A smoke and bitter chocolate aftertaste suggests some firm extraction.",87
,Deltetto 2006 Sistaglia  (Barolo),There's a beautifully delicate nature to this wine that is evident in its pristine floral aromas and its feminine notes of raspberry and wild berry. Hints of smoke and tar appear at the end and the wine is tight and firm in the mouth. Don't worry about longevity; there's enough pulp and structure to guarantee a   long aging future ahead.,92
Roger Voss,Drappier 1995 Carte d'Or Brut 1.5 liters  (Champagne),"With 14 years age, this Champagne shows plenty of beautifully mature fruit. At the same time, its petrol and toast aromas and flavors are balanced by soft richness, a rounded citric and pear flavor and a gentle, ripe aftertaste.",92
Roger Voss,Drappier 2002 Millésime Exception Brut  (Champagne),"This is a balanced wine, moving easily between rich fruit and a tight mineral and grapefruit texture. There is a hint of toast to give extra weight. Worth aging for several years.",92
,Falcone 2008 Syrah (Paso Robles),"Earns a high score for sheer richness and decadance. Huge in blackberry, blueberry, cassis, dark chocolate, bacon, pepper and oak flavors, wrapped into big, velvety tannins. Impresses for its size, but is totally dry, and retains balance and elegance. Now–2015.",92
,Fratelli Alessandria 2006 Gramolere  (Barolo),"Barolo Gramolere offers an attractive window onto the Nebbiolo grape with peek views at its inherent complexity and elegance. The wine opens with a ruby-garnet color and offers aromas of wild berry, white cherry, tar, licorice, hazelnut and ginger.",92
,G D Vajra 2006 Bricco delle Viole  (Barolo),"Barolo Bricco delle Viole is a lush and generous wine with a bright ruby color and attractively intense aromas of cherry, wild berry, nutmeg, clove, powdered licorice and root beer. The oak influence is still obvious at this early stage, but will no doubt integrate with time. The mouthfeel is exceedingly soft, smooth and velvety. You don't need to wait too many years before uncorking this bottle.",92
,G D Vajra 2006 Luigi Baudana Cerretta  (Barolo),"Very different from the Bricco delle Viole cru expression from the same producer, this wine offers bold, ripe fruit with lingering tones of red cherry, leather, charcoal and campfire. The fruit is thick and succulent and the finish offers sweet, succulent spice flavors. Multiple U.S. importers.",92
,Gian Piero Marrone 2006 Pichemej  (Barolo),"This Barolo with the vocally challenging name Pichemej reveals a dark and moody side that is reinforced by aromas of black fruit, plum, pressed rose, tar and asphalt. There's a textured, earthy quality here followed by firmly drying tannins. Pair this wine with tender beef ribs.",92
,Grimaldi Bruna 2006 Camilla  (Barolo),"This Barolo exhibits sweet aromas of berry fruit, Christmas spice and vanilla. It's a bold, confident wine with a smooth but firm quality in the mouth that hits all the right marks. Pair this Barolo with marinated lamb and dried fig jelly.",92

Roger Voss,Zull 2008 Eiswein 375ml Riesling (Niederösterreich),"Intense acidity, with the sweetness held in check by a bright, crisp character. Rich honey is balanced by an exquisite freshness, lightly perfumed, so clean and clear in final taste.",92
Roger Voss,Norbert Bauer 2008 Eiswein 375ml Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),"Both crisp and rich, a magical combination with beautiful acidity, light currants, the whole wine infused with honey. The final acidity leaves a long-lasting aftertaste.",92
,Sawyer 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"A beautifully accessible wine, polished, pretty and likeable now for its gentle texture and silky tannins. The sweet cherry and raspberry fruit is encircled with a coat of fancy smoked oak. Made from 100% Cabernet, the wine is balanced enough to gain bottle complexity for a decade.",92
,Sullivan 2007 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"Here's a powerful Cabernet Sauvignon, ripe and opulent, offering summer blackberry, sour cherry candy, currant, dried herb and rose petal aromas and flavors. The addition of 21% Merlot brings a candied softness, but it's still pretty tannic, and wants 4–5 years in the cellar.",92
,Tenuta Arnulfo 2006 Costa di Bussia  (Barolo),"Here's a very attractive and seductive Barolo with chiseled mineral tones that really help the wine stand out in a crowd. Layers of graphite and slate give purity, linearity and clarity to this austere and elegant expression. Earthy tones, as well as forest berry flavors, appear on the long finish.",92
,Tenuta Rocca 2006  Barolo,"Founded in 1986, Tenuta Rocca is a hilltop property in Monforte d'Alba that overlooks some of the most beautiful landscapes in the Langhe. This wonderful Barolo opens with sweet smells of candle wax, nutmeg, ginger, chocolate and bright red fruit. The wine imparts a squeaky clean, polished feel in the mouth.",92
,Battaglio 2007  Barbaresco,"Mario Battaglio offers a truly fantastic expression of Nebbiolo from the hot 2007 vintage that is packed tight with intensity and larger than life aromatic opulence. In a surprise twist, the wine also boasts a feminine side thanks to delicate aromas of wild flowers, licorice and light graphite or mineral shadings.",92
,Cascina Ballarin 2006 Bricco Rocca  (Barolo),"Barolo Bricco Rocca still needs a few more years in the cellar to allow for full integrations of its spice, fruit, tobacco and mineral components. This beautiful wine is ripe with potential and the mouthfeel is plush and velvety with a wonderful fade of smoke and black fruit. Drink after 2018.",92
,Cavalier Bartolomeo 2006 Cannubi San Lorenzo  (Barolo),"Here's a wine that begs a pairing with a truffle dish: black truffle Cornish hen or creamy risotto with white truffle flakes would do the trick. Cannubi San Lorenzo's aromas include spice, cherry, cola, white licorice, white mushroom and smoked ham. This is a beautiful wine with a firm, determined but elegant finish.",92
,Cavallotto 2004 Bricco Boschis Riserva Vigna San Giuseppe  (Barolo),"Here's a vineyard-designate Barolo Riserva with pristine aromas of cherry, wild berry, smoke, tar, licorice and leather. The streamlined mouthfeel is polished yet firm, and the wine offers a long fade of cherry and spice flavors.",92
,Damilano 2006 Cannubi  (Barolo),"The prized Cannubi cru offers fruit that is interpreted by some of the finest winemakers in northern Italy. This expression from the dynamic Damilano winery is characterized by tight tannins, power, personality and ripe berry flavors. Pair this Barolo with risotto topped with thinly shaved truffles.",92
,Giacomo Grimaldi 2006 Le Coste  (Barolo),"Very different than the 2005 vintage, Barolo Le Coste from Giacomo Grimaldi opens with a brownish-amber color and ripe berry or candied fruit aromas. There are beautifully fine aromas of tar, asphalt and licorice in the background that help balance it out. A Marc de Grazia selection; various American importers.",92
,Broman 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"This brilliant Sauvignon Blanc should be scooped up by sommeliers. It's exceptionally dry and tart in citrusy acids, with a mineral scour that's perfect for shellfish or savory appetizers. The flavors are of lemons, limes, gooseberries and white pepper. Beautiful and compelling.",91
Roger Voss,De Sousa & Fils NV Réserve Blanc de Blancs Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),"From 100% grand cru Chardonnay vineyards in the Côte des Blancs, this is a rich but almost bone-dry wine. It has a great mineral character that offers freshness, apple skins and a flinty edge. The disgorgement date is indicated on the bottle. Impressive, this would benefit from six months' aging.",91
,Dutton-Goldfield 2007 Dutton Ranch-Freestone Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"From a cool part of the valley, this wine is marked by fresh acids that give it a grapey jamminess. It's very rich in black cherries, black raspberries and toast, and very dry. Feels sharp and angular now. Give it through 2010 to calm down.",91
,Dutton-Goldfield 2008 Dutton Ranch-Green Valley Vineyard Gewürztraminer (Green Valley),"A beautiful Gewürz that could get more people to drink this Alsatian variety. It's dry and crisp, with rich flavors of citrus and tropical fruits, honeysuckle flowers, lychee nuts, vanilla and Asian spices.",90
,Twisted Oak 2007 River of Skulls Dalton Vineyard Red (Calaveras County),"You want black pepper? You'll get plenty of it in this dry, interesting Rhône blend of Mourvèdre and Syrah. It has briary flavors of wild blackberries, with an edge of leather, tobacco and herbs, and is thoroughly dry. Pretty tannic, too. An interesting wine, and one to watch.",90
,Waypoint 2006 Beckstoffer Missouri Hopper Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A very fine Cabernet, dry and firm, but it needs a little time in the cellar. Astringent now, it has a deep core of black currants and cedar, with the polished tannins that Napa so easily crafts. Try between 2010–2012.",90
Paul Gregutt,Whitman Cellars 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Much improved, with different vineyard sources than in 2004, this strong, varietal Cabernet mixes cassis, black cherry, light herb and hints of moist earth. Aging for 18 months in new French oak brings in coffee and chocolate, balanced and subtly displayed. Nice details of leaf and leather run richly into the tannins.",90
,Wild Oak by St. Francis 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),"A good Cab, dry and balanced, whose tannins are richly impressive and sweet. Shows a good tension between the oak and the ripe black currants. Easy to like, and should develop for a few years.",90
,Alma Rosa 2007 La Encantada Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Elegantly structured, with firm tannins, a silky texture and a fine balance of fruit, acidity and oak. Shows cherry, red currant, cola and sandalwood flavors that are delicious, but those tannins close in on the finish, making the wine hard. Try after 2011.",90
Roger Voss,Vieux Château Gaubert 2005  Graves,"A 50/50 blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, this shows big fruity flavors tempered with a dry core of tannins. There is a stalky element of black currant skins which adds to the sensation of dryness, but there is also a more mouthfilling character of black plum juice to give the wine a final roundness.",90
,Allegrini 2004  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,"This is a thickly extracted Amarone with fruit-driven aromas of strawberry, cherry and blackberry preserves. It is inky and dark in color with impenetrable density and a smooth quality to its tannins. Allegrini is one of the most historic and well-respected producers in Valpolicella.",90
Paul Gregutt,Balboa 2007 Reserve Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Tangy berry/black cherry fruit is backed with lots of acid and hints of earthy funk. It's not vegetal but it is definitely herbal, a complex and flavorful reserve that falls right between Balboa's regular Syrah and the Sayulita.",90
,Benanti 2005 Lamorèmio Red (Sicilia),"Lamorèmio is a blend of Nerello Mascalese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Nero d'Avola in equal parts that tastes of Indian spice, clove, sweet cinnamon and blackberry. You'll also get a touch of caper or green olive that rides on the heels of the wine's smooth, supple mouthfeel.",90
,Benanti 2006 Il Monovitigno Nerello Mascalese (Sicilia),"Il Monovitigno is a pure expression of Nerello Mascalese—Mt. Etna's most promising variety—with aromas of black olive, Indian spice, mesquite, black fruit and volcanic ash. It's tonic and fresh in the mouth and encourages a pairing with spicy meat recipes.",90
Roger Voss,Château Pavillon Bel-Air 2006  Lalande de Pomerol,"A richly Merlot wine, soft, ripe, packed with black jelly flavors, sweet acidity and generous balanced tannins. The flavors come together in a balanced, rich way. An attractive wine, ready to drink now.",90
Paul Gregutt,Coeur d'Alene 2006 Opulence Syrah (Washington),"Opulence is the reserve Syrah, a firm and juicy wine with dark, smoky, wild berry flavors. It's gamy and brambly, chewy and tart, and it has the length and polish to sustain your interest through glass after glass.",90
Michael Schachner,Concha y Toro 2008 Terrunyo El Triángulo Vineyard Block: 28 Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),"We won't call this the best Terrunyo SB to date, but it is typically clean, mineral and full of lime and passion fruit. The overall balance and purity are up the ladder, while the flavors of green fruits, passion fruit, brine and lime don't hold back. Top notch SB from Chile to drink now.",90
Roger Voss,Deutz 2005 Rosé Brut  (Champagne),"Following the elegant Deutz tradition, this wine has a character that is light as a feather, but still anchored into vivid red fruits and tight acidity, leavened by a softness. The final taste is soft, but well integrated.",90
,J Vineyards & Winery 2007 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Ripe and oaky. May fall a bit short on complexity and finesse, but makes up for it in sheer power. Pineapple crème brûlée, spicy green apple butter, ripe pear, Asian spices and smoky oak are the flavors, backed with firm acidity.",90
,James Family Cellars 2007 Stony Point Vineyards Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Young and fresh in citrusy acidity, with forward fruit flavors of cherries, raspberries, pomegranates, cola, bacon and sweet oak. Good and dry and silky, but immature.",90
,Long Meadow Ranch 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is an example of a lighter, drier style of Cabernet that maintains great elegance and charm. It's very dry, showing blackberry, black currant, herb and cedar flavors wrapped into firm tannins, and brightened with crispness. Best now–2011.",90
Michael Schachner,Marchiori & Barraud 2007 Cuartel 2 Marchiori Vineyard Malbec (Perdriel),"Aggressive smelling early on but then it settles on classy raspberry, cassis and herbs. The palate is very healthy, juicy, rich and big, but the flavors of dark berry fruit are subtle and smooth. Chunky, sweet and ripe on the finish. A Malbec to drink this winter. Only 300 cases produced.",90
Michael Schachner,Morandé 2007 Edición Limitada Carmenère (Maipo Valley),"It's been a while since we've reviewed this wine, so this is a fine comeback. Plum, blackberry and rubber aromas are solid, but the real star is the palate, which is smooth and thick, with lush dark fruit flavors and a smoky background. Good, slightly herbal and long on the finish.",90
,Newsome-Harlow 2007 El Portal Petite Sirah (Calaveras County),"It's hard to make Petite Sirah smooth and elegant, but Newsome-Harlow has done it. The wine shows classically fine tannins, while the flavors run toward milk chocolate, ripe blackberries and lots of crushed black pepper. Delicious and refined, a great wine for peppersteak.",90
,Pali 2007 Turner Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Great now with lamb, this Pinot is softly complex and forward in fruit, with a silky texture. It shows cherry, raspberry, mocha, anise and smoky oak flavors. Best now and for a few more years.",90
,Peju 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"This is Peju's best Sauvignon Blanc in many years. It's bone dry and elegantly crisp in acidity, a clean, vibrant, food-friendly wine. With just a hint of oak, it shows rich flavors of Meyer lemons and limes, with exotic notes of papaya and white flowers. What a great comeback.",90
,Quivira 2007 Wine Creek Ranch Grenache (Dry Creek Valley),"Could almost be Zinfandel, it's so spicy and briary, with wild berry, red currant and tobacco flavors. But it's lighter in body, with the silky texture of Pinot Noir, and drier than any Zin could be. A lovely, complex and food-friendly wine.",90
Roger Voss,Soutiran NV Brut Grand Cru  (Champagne),"If you want to taste ripe Pinot Noir in Champagne, this grand cru blend (with 40% Chardonnay, 60% Pinot Noir) from Soutiran is where to come. The wine has weight, delicious white fruits and kiwi, and a textured mouthfeel. It is concentrated, certainly in a food wine style.",90
Paul Gregutt,SuLei 2007 Beet Red Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"A nicely crafted debut from a new Walla Walla boutique. The blend—two thirds Cabernet Sauvignon, one third Syrah—is becoming a classic in Walla Walla. This wraps delicious caramel around bright berries and plums. It's nicely focused, smooth and compact, but feels like a wine that will flesh out with a bit more bottle age.",90
Roger Voss,J. Portugal Ramos 2006 Marquês de Borba White (Alentejo),"Named after local nobility in the city of Borba, this is a popular brand in Portugal. In its white manifestation, the wine is soft, very clean, with pear and cinnamon flavors, the texture just moving toward fat, but working well as a food wine.",87
,Tolloy 2007 Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige),"Honey, kiwi, mango and peach come to mind and color an easy, but fragrant Grigio from the mountains of northern Italy that would pair well with exotic or Asian foods. It closes with spicy acidity and is a perfect palate cleaner.",87
,Pighin 2006 Pinot Grigio (Collio),"This Pinot Grigio from northern Italy has good density and direct aromas of honey, peach and grapefruit that make for a well balanced ensemble. The wine is fresh and clean and would pair with grilled calamari or Thai mango shrimp.",87
Roger Voss,Quinta de Serrade 2006 Solar de Serrade Alvarinho (Vinho Verde),"A fine, crisp wine, with delicious green apple flavors and a tang of lime, a touch of yeast, and a dry, fresh aftertaste. There's a delicious bite to this fragrant wine.",87
,Racchus 2005 Chardonnay (Central Coast),"A nice, crisp Chard that has pineapple, peach, pear and caramel-vanilla flavors that turn honeyed and spicy on the finish. From the Sonoma producer Ty Caton.",87
,Ronco del Gelso 2006 Sot Lis Rivis Pinot Grigio (Isonzo del Friuli),This delightful Pinot Grigio offers remarkable clarity and precision and generous tones of stone fruit and citrus while being creamy and rich in density. Pair it with your favorite seafood recipes.,87
,Sobon Estate 2006 Cougar Hill Zinfandel (Amador County),"Forward and easy in cherry, currant, raspberry, tangerine zest, cola and peppery spice flavors, this Zin has a gentle texture. There's also a wealth of firm, dusty tannins that could help the wine age for a few years.",87
,Rocca Bernarda 2006 Vineis White (Colli Orientali del Friuli),"Creamy and full in the glass with thick streaks of glycerin, this is a luminous white blend with pretty aromas of stone fruit, honey and peach cobbler. The wine has a smooth, full consistency and a soft, generous finish.",87
,Stephen's 2005 Encell Vineyard Pinot Noir (San Luis Obispo County),"Dark, soft and rich, this single-vineyard Pinot brims with deep, almost brooding flavors of red currants, cherries, red plums, mocha and dusty spices. It also has an edge of tannins that will help it negotiate a good steak. Drink over the next several years.",87
,Kenneth Volk 2005 Sierra Madre Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),"Former Wild Horse proprietor Ken Volk is back with his own personal brand after selling the winery. He's sourced his fruit from this very famous old vineyard. It's a good start, a deep golden wine showing ripe apricot, pear and sweet smoky oak flavors.",87
,Lava Cap 2004 Reserve Cabernet Franc (El Dorado),"A very easy wine to like. It's so softly balanced, so rich in cherries, licorice and smoky vanilla, so light in texture, you could drink it as a cocktail wine. But it will also nicely complement a wide variety of foods.",87
,Masottina 2006 Incrocio Manzoni 6.0.13 Manzoni (Colli Trevigiani),"This Manzoni (a cross between Riesling and Pinot Bianco) opens with a pretty, luminous glow and offers pristine aromas of stone fruit, mango and vanilla. Natural structure and smoothness underscore the variety's pairing potential with most Thai or Indian dishes.",87
,Comelli 2006 Amplius Pinot Grigio (Colli Orientali del Friuli),"Although Pinot Grigios are white wines, you could consider this a rosé instead because of its luminous copper color. The wine boasts a thick, creamy consistency and has a generous, plush feel in the mouth. It's a special and carefully crafted wine.",87
Roger Voss,Cortes de Cima 2005 Aragonez Aragonês (Alentejano),"Ripe, smooth, just veering toward rustic, but also showing a fine balance of tannins and sweet fruit. It is certainly rich, while the spicy character, with the dried fruits, is generous. The acidity is understated.",87
Michael Schachner,De Martino 2006 Legado Reserva Carmenère (Maipo Valley),"A little sweet, dense and pasty on the nose, and that's also how the wine plays out. It's a ripe style of Carmenère, with brooding but not overly expressive black-fruit flavors. Ripeness is clearly not an issue as it shows no vegetal or herbal notes. Simply big, bold and not terribly unique.",87
,Eugenio Collavini 2007 Villa Canlungo Pinot Grigio (Collio),"This is a fuller and creamier rendition of Pinot Grigio with pretty aromas of honey, peach blossom and melon that give the wine a fragrant aromatic lift. It leaves a lean but smooth impression in the mouth and ends with bright citrus flavors. Imported by MW Imports.",87
,Fenestra 2005 Pinot Noir (Livermore Valley),"You don't think of Livermore Valley as Pinot territory, but this is a pretty nice wine. It's medium-bodied and silky, with pleasurable flavors of cherries, red currants, cola, vanilla and smoke, and a long, sweetly spicy finish.",87
,Folonari 2007 Chardonnay Chardonnay (Delle Venezie),"This delicious Chardonnay offers creamy opulence and rich notes of vanilla, honey and peach. It has dense, slightly sweet, fruit flavors lavished over good structure and ends with spicy crispness. Pair it with white meat or pasta salad.",87
Paul Gregutt,Brimstone 2006 Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (OR)),"This Cab/Merlot/Syrah blend is very much in a Washington style, with crisp acids and tart berry and currant flavors, wrapped in chocolate and showing a few specks of pepper, presumably from the Syrah. It's solid and well-made and a good example of how Oregon vintners are breaking out of the Pinot box.",87
,Castello di Porcìa 2006 Pinot Bianco Pinot Bianco (Friuli Grave),"Here is a full-force Pinot Bianco with compelling notes of mature apricot, candied fruit, honey, pine nut and maple syrup. The wine has a saturated, golden hue and resin-like flavors that add texture and dimension.",87
Joe Czerwinski,Château Calissanne 2006 Clos Victoire White (Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence),"A blend of 70% Clairette, 15% Sémillon and 15% Rolle, this is a slightly nutty, almondy white with touches of honeyed richness and apricot. Turns a bit astringent on the finish.",87
Joe Czerwinski,Château du Galoupet 2005 Tibur Rosé (Côtes de Provence),"Here's an interesting rosé fans of obscure winegrapes will love. It's 90% Tibouren, an old variety indigenous to Provence that's known for its finesse but also for its difficulty in the vineyard. This wine also stays an entire year in tank resting on its lees, so it's not a fruit-forward rosé at all. Hints of apricot and peach are subtle, with the emphasis being on the wines crisp acids and dry finish.",87
Roger Voss,Château Beauvillage 2009  Médoc,"Ripe and juicy, this is packed with black currant fruit and lined with soft, open tannins. The wine has a dry core, yet this is surrounded by attractive smoky fruit and bright acidity. Ready to drink now.",88
Roger Voss,Château Cap Léon Veyrin 2009  Listrac-Médoc,This is a very rich wine with black fruit and bitter coffee flavors and dense tannins. Its weight is almost too much for the firm structure that is underneath.,88
Susan Kostrzewa,Gerovassiliou 2007 Evangelo Red (Epanomi),"Big fruit aromas of plum, raspberry and a whiff of pepper start this enjoyable red from Gerovassiliou. On the palate, flavors of spicy black fruit, clove and smoke appeal and should pair well with grilled meat dishes and stews.",88
,Firestone 2008 Merlot (Santa Ynez Valley),"This delivers the soft, velvety texture you want in a nice Merlot, along with ripe black-cherry, anise, cola and sandalwood flavors that finish dry and spicy.",88
Paul Gregutt,Gård 2010 Lawrence Vineyards Dry Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Tart and juicy, this nicely balanced Riesling mixes fruit flavors of orange, Meyer lemon and tangerine. The acids are natural and tangy, and the overall balance is just right.",88
Paul Gregutt,Alexandria Nicole 2009 Quarry Butte Destiny Ridge Vineyards Estate Grown Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"A blend of approximately 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, with Merlot, Malbec, Syrah and Petit Verdot making up the remainder, this barbecue-ready wine is scented with dried herb and forest floor components. Brambly berry fruit and tart acids work to balance out the earthy tannins.",88
Virginie Boone,Andis 2010 Barbera (Amador County),"Andis's 100% Barbera tempts with ripe, dried black-cherry and mint flavors, and toasty layers of coffee and toffee that linger until the finish.",88
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Anthony Nappa 2010 Bordo Cabernet Franc (North Fork of Long Island),There's a savage appeal (what the French call sauvage) to this unabashedly rustic Cabernet Franc that was fermented entirely using wild yeasts. Initial notes of tomato leaf and green stem blow off to reveal aripe red fruit with a gorgeously floral character. Tart acidity and a concentrated red-cherry flavor are accented with graphite and black tea notes.,88
Roger Voss,Château au Pont de Guitres 2009  Lalande de Pomerol,"Packed with superripe Merlot, this is rich and round. It has wood flavors and sweet, juicy black-plum fruits that are balanced by firm tannins. The finish shows some bitterness from over-extraction.",88
Roger Voss,Château Bellegrave du Poujeau 2006  Haut-Médoc,"Now maturing, this retains its red fruits; its bright texture and acidity go with the firm tannins and dark structure. It is balanced and ready to drink.",88
Roger Voss,Château Haut-Goujon 2008 La Rose Saint-Vincent  (Lalande de Pomerol),"This is structured and firm, with its dry tannins prominent along with blackberry and black cherry acidity. The wine does have density, a dusty texture and the chance to further age.",88
Roger Voss,Château La Fleur Plaisance 2009  Montagne-Saint-Émilion,"This shows the rich density of Merlot in 2009, giving a solid structure, with dried fruit and red berry flavors and a concentrated line of tannins. Big and dense, this is ready to age.",88
,Justin 2008 Isoceles Reserve Red (Paso Robles),"A very rich wine—this has a warm, soft mouthfeel and ripe, jammy flavors enhanced with oak. Except for the heat, it's a lovely wine. Drink now.",88
,Leese-Fitch 2010 Chardonnay (California),"Easily as good as Chardonnays costing two or three times as much, this is a great value, and with production at 12,000 cases, it should be fairly easy to find. It's rich in orange, apricot and buttered toast flavors, with balancing acidity and a dry finish.",88
,Martin Ray 2010 Reserve Merlot (Oak Knoll District),"With a rich, velvety texture and flavors of black cherries, green olives and smoky cedar, this is a very nice Merlot for drinking now. Drink this with upscale fare.",88
Paul Gregutt,Obelisco Estate 2009 Reserve Merlot (Red Mountain),"This is 75% Merlot, with Cabernet, Malbec and Syrah comprising the other 25%. Despite all of the components, it tastes like there is a bit of a hole. The fruit is soft and plummy, and the overall balance is excellent.",88
,Ponchione Maurizio 2009 Monfrini  (Roero),"This opens has a bold appearance with dark extraction. The aromas that follow are reminiscent of ripe cherry, cinnamon spice, plum and pulpy black fruit. Round and soft, this closes with firm grittiness.",88
Roger Voss,Fournier Père et Fils 2010 Côtes de Morogues  (Menetou-Salon),"One of the small Sauvignon Blanc areas close to Sancerre, Menetou-Salon produces a light, crisp and herbal style of wine. This fits that bill well, its freshness contained within the flavors of hedgerow fruits and tangy acids.",88
,Freeman 2010 Ryo-Fu Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Everything in this wine is strong and obvious: With its powerful tropical fruit, sweet oak and intense finish, this is what many Americans like in Chardonnay. But as impressive as the winemaker's art is here, the flash is all on the surface. Drink up.",88
Roger Voss,Horeau-Beylot 2010 Château la Fleur Poitou  (Lussac Saint-Émilion),"Smooth and rich, this has superripe Merlot. It has soft, jammy red-fruit flavors and tannins that are enveloped by the opulent texture. The tannins should allow the wine to age over 3–6 years.",88
,Bersano 2009 Costalunga  (Barbera d'Asti),"Blackberry, tobacco and spice flavors give this an appropriate air of sophistication. It should pair with pizza or pasta.",88
Kerin O’Keefe,Carletto 2015  Montepulciano d'Abruzzo,"Here's a rustic zesty red that has aromas of ripe berry, game and whiff of tilled soil. The gamy note carries over to the simple, quaffable palate along with ripe black cherry and a hint of dark spice. Drink soon.",85
Michael Schachner,Codorníu NV Reserva Cuvée Barcelona 1872 Sparkling (Cava),"Clover and apple aromas are basic but fresh. This is simple on the palate, with little to the mouthfeel. Vapid flavors of soda crackers, spent yeast and apple cider disappear on a quick finish.",85
Jim Gordon,2Plank 2014 Zinfandel (Amador County),"This superripe, late-harvest style of wine smells like raisins and dried plums. It tastes so fruity and ripe that it's sweet, with a full body to match. It would be best as a dessert wine.",84
Joe Czerwinski,Angove 2014 Family Crest Chardonnay (McLaren Vale),"Brassy in color and woody in aroma, this Chardonnay is a pleasant enough drink, offering ample weight and modest pear and citrus flavors. Drink it through 2017.",84
Michael Schachner,Bodegas Riojanas 2015 Canchales Vino Joven  (Rioja),"Rubbery raspberry and plum aromas are decent. This feels crisp and abrasive on the surface, but sort of empty in the middle. Lean snappy plum and raspberry flavors end with scratchy tannins and a medicinal aftertaste.",84
Kerin O’Keefe,La Fiera 2015  Montepulciano d'Abruzzo,"Purple flower and mature dark berry aromas lift out of the glass. Extremely simple and diluted, the palate offers suggestions of morello cherry, a hint of spice and loose-knit fleeting tannins.",84
Michael Schachner,Gorrebusto 2015  Rioja,"Candied berry aromas lack crispness. This feels hard, with little give and depth to the palate. Burnt toasted berry flavors are hot and fall off on a clumsy finish.",84

Roger Voss,Château Kalon Nodoz 2012 Carpe Diem  (Côtes de Bourg),"The wine is lean for the vintage, tight and with an austere structure. Its tannins and juicy red fruits are in the background. The aftertaste is dry and firm.",84
Roger Voss,L. Tramier & Fils 2015 Collection  (Moulin-à-Vent),"Too alcoholic for its own good, the wine is full bodied and heavy. It has tannins, superripe black fruits while missing structure and acidity. It is developing fast and will be ready to drink from 2017.",84

Michael Schachner,Sonsierra 2015 Selección Tempranillo Rosé (Rioja),"This pink wine smells of red-apple skins. The palate is low on acidity but not entirely dull. Dry briny lightly bitter flavors don't show a lot of fruit, while this is pulpy on the finish.",84
Paul Gregutt,South Stage 2012 Carmenère (Rogue Valley),"This shows the tannic chewy, vegetal nature of the grape, without off-setting it with other flavors. One-third new French oak has made little impact, and the wine is rough and astringent through a quick finish.",84

Michael Schachner,Venta Morales 2015 Made With Organic Grapes Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),"Heavy oak aromas sit atop wiry plum and spice scents.

Jim Gordon,Grayson 2015 Lot 6 Merlot (California),"This light-colored and light-bodied wine combines an earthy, metallic aroma with mildly fruity, candied flavors. Its texture is mild and smooth.",84
Michael Schachner,Bodegas Isidro Milagro 2015 SPÑ Red (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),"Prickly berry aromas include notes of both candied raspberry and cinnamon. This feels a bit clunky and sticky, with sugary berry flavors and a slightly cloying finish.",84
Michael Schachner,Campos de Risca 2013 Estate Wine Organic Monastrell-Syrah (Jumilla),"Dusty aromas of desert brush, oak, blueberry, animal hide and green herbs are strained.

Kerin O’Keefe,Castorani 2014 Le Paranze  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo),"Aromas of plum, violet and a whiff of spice emerge on this extremely simple red. The short diluted palate suggests red cherry and a hint of vanilla alongside frail tannins.",84
Jim Gordon,Bota Box 2015 Riesling (California),"Slightly sweet and quite light in body, this wine has modest peach and herb aromas, generic fruit flavors and a soft texture.",84
Michael Schachner,Lo Nuevo 2015 Covello Albariño (Rías Baixas),"Lemon and apple aromas precede a high-acid citric palate without much elegance or finesse. This pedestrian Albariño deals pithy orange flavors that come with a note of grape skins. On the finish, this seems like orange juice.",84
Paul Gregutt,Wetzel Estate 2012 Premier Cuvée Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"High-toned aromatics complement aggressive, unintegrated flavors of raw wood. It's lumber, not toast, that you taste, along with bitter tannins and little evidence of ripe fruit.",84

Jim Gordon,La Folia Winery 2015 Vermentino (Sierra Foothills),"A touch of smoky petrol in the aroma and flavor adds intrigue to this full-bodied, creamy-textured wine.

Drink 2021–2028.",90
Jim Gordon,Mt. Konocti Winery 2015 Vin de Glace Muscat (Lake County),"Made as an ice wine, this sweet treat smells nutty, honeyed and a touch earthy It tastes rich, like salted peanuts coated with toffee and apricot syrup.

Roger Voss,Domaine Leflaive 2009 Les Pucelles Premier Cru  (Puligny-Montrachet),"This rich wine balances ripe yellow fruits with intense citrus acidity in a harmonious whole. Its structure is laden with minerality, toast and a smooth, delicious creamy aftertaste.",94
,Dutton Estate 2010 Dutton Palms Vineyard Dutton Ranch Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"The vineyard is in the coolest part of the Green Valley of the Russian River Valley. The wine, which is totally dry, is marked by brilliant acidity and long hangtime flavors of oranges, Meyer lemons and kiwi fruit, enriched by barrel fermentation and aging.",94
,Verbena 2007  Brunello di Montalcino,"Here's a gorgeous wine with a deep, inky color and super extraction that is elegant but powerful at the same time. This is a balanced wine, but it's also an intense wine, with loads of ripe fruit, spice and tobacco. It feels smooth and rich, with a finely crafted texture that is velvety and supple.",94
,Castello Romitorio 2007  Brunello di Montalcino,"This is a lovely Brunello with black cherry, plum, smoke, bacon, leather and a drying touch of crushed mineral on the nose. It is rich and concentrated, with a slightly sweet-smelling bouquet. The mouthfeel is compact, tight and polished—but there is excellent length too.",94
,Il Poggiolo E. Cosimi 2006 Il Mio Brunello Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),"Inky color, with a broad array of aromas, including earth, candied fruit, plum cake and cinnamon spice. Smooth and luscious in the mouth, where its tight structure shows promising potential for longevity.",94
,Kazmer & Blaise 2009 Primo's Hill Pinot Noir (Carneros),"A terrific Pinot Noir, from a winery compiling a serious track record. Grown on the Napa side of Carneros, the wine shows classic Primo's Hill character, with the blackberry pie, cola, mushu plum and sandalwood flavors accented by a little more acidity than usual. Defined by elegance and complexity, it's an ager, although it's beautiful now right out of the bottle. Should easily develop through 2015.",94
,Kirkland Signature 2007 Series Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is a big, mouthfilling Cabernet, rich and voluptuous in fruit. Although it's a bit hot in alcohol, you hardly notice it, with the explosion of blackberries, raisins and chocolate-covered cherries, made even richer by smoky-sweet oak. Delicious now and through 2014.",87
,Mantra 2006 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"A bit disjointed, with acidity sticking out, and the fruit tending toward jammy blackberries, raspberries and nectarines, leading to sharpness in the finish. Could mellow and improve in a couple years.",87
,Turn Four 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A good Cab, chockful of grilled blackberry, cassis, cocoa and sweet smoky oak flavors that finish rich and spicy. Has some real elegance, at an affordable price.",87
Michael Schachner,Viña Cobos 2007 Felino Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),"Chunky, broad and slightly rubbery smelling, with baked aromas, leather and other more serious scents. The palate is full-bodied and warm, but not all that complex. Flavors of baked plums, cassis and licorice are nice, and the finish brings chocolate brownie into the game. For immediate drinking.",87
,X 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Rich, savory and appealing now for its smooth texture and forward flavors of cherries, raspberries, blackberries and oak. A lovely wine for grilled steaks and chops.",87
,Ballast Stone Estate Wines 2006 Shiraz (McLaren Vale),"Not a wine for the faint of heart. Alluring notes of raspberry, blackberry, smoke and coconut set the scene for powerful flavors of strawberry and black pepper in the mouth. Tannins are abundant but polished. The finish is a bit of a disappointment, with a whisper of astringency and a huge hit of coconut. Still, well done and fairly priced. Drink with steak.",87
,Cantine Sant'Agata 2007 Pro Nobis  (Ruché di Castagnole Monferrato),"Pro Nobis is a good example of the Ruché grape (a mysterious variety from Piedmont with some similarities to Brachetto). The wine offers aromas of wild berries and blue violets, backed by medium consistency and bright acidity. Pair it with cheesy pasta dishes.",87
Roger Voss,Château la Tour de By 2008 Barrel sample  (Médoc),"86-88 Barrel sample. Densely structured wine, all rich plums and berry fruit flavors. There is a strong amount of wood, but it is the juicy, just green, character of the wine which is most prominent.",87
Roger Voss,Château Larrivet Haut-Brion 2008 Barrel sample  (Pessac-Léognan),"86-88 Barrel sample An aroma that is almost port-like in its sweetness. To taste, the structure is lost in a swathe of ripeness that covers the fruit.",87
,Colle dei Venti 2006  Barbera d'Asti,"Tonic and fresh with vibrant tones of wild berry and forest floor, there is a rustic, almost savage quality to this wine that is really quite attractive. It would pair well with home-cooked meals of hand-kneaded pasta or boiled meats.",87
Roger Voss,La Chapelle de Potensac 2008 Barrel sample  (Médoc),"86-88 Barrel sample. Firm, with a bitter, tight edge, this has high acidity, spice, and a tight layer of tannins. For a second wine, this is not that accessible.",87
,Salis 1637 2002 Canua  (Valtellina Superiore),"One of Italy's most interesting and least-know wines, Sforzato di Valetellina is made with dried Nebbiolo grapes in much the same way Amarone is made. In fact, sforzato means “forced” in Italian and alludes to the extra concentration given to the wine. With herbal and some bitter, leafy green notes, it's not a wine for everyone; it's sour in the mouth with an acid-driven close.",87
,La Scolca 2004 Pinot Nero (Oltrepò Pavese),"There's a tonic quality to this Pinot Nero that combines ashy mineral notes with wild berries, toasted almonds and blue flowers. There's also a warm, sun-drenched quality that adds to the overall intensity and concentration.",87
Roger Voss,Château Malescasse 2008 Barrel sample  (Haut-Médoc),"86-88 Barrel sample. Despite its initial edge of bitterness, this develops as a dense wine, packed with dark high toast and blackberry jelly flavors. The final bite of high extract spoils the finish.",87
Roger Voss,Proidl 2008 Senftenberger Freiheit Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),"This is the lightest of the Grüners from Proidl, offering a refreshing burst of crisp acidity along with the freshest spice. There is a fine tang of lemon, to keep the whole wine as bright as possible.",87
,Seventy Five Wine Co. 2006 Amber Knolls Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Hills Lake County),"Andy Beckstoffer is starting to release wines from his Red Hills vineyards, and this release is promising, especially at this price. It's fruity and tasty in blackberries and cherries, while oak adds rich notes of caramel and vanilla. Rich and savory, this Cab delivers lots to like.",87
,St. Francis 2007 Rowe Vineyard Old Vines Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"Here's a lusty, rugged Zinfandel marked by strong, superripe flavors. The blackberries and plums veer into currants and raisins, and finish spicy and dry, while enormously high alcohol gives the impression of heat. But that's Zinfandel for you. Needs a grilled flank steak to play against.",87
,Stephen's 2006 Stromsoe Vineyard Pinot Noir (San Luis Obispo County),"Made in a lighter style, this silky Pinot Noir has crisp acidity accentuating flavors of cherries, red licorice and cola. It's an elegant wine for drinking now.",87
,Adobe Road 2006 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Here's a big, bold Zinfandel that shows the variety's rustic, briary character. It's dry and tannic and rather high in alcohol, with flavors of wild, ripe forest berries, peppery spices, currants, bacon and sweet, smoky cedar. Nice now with BBQ.",87
,Arrowood 2007 Chardonnay (Sonoma County),"Rich in fruit and oak, but balanced with crisp acidity. It's strongly flavored, brimming with pineapple jam, white peach, apricot, buttered toast and vanilla. Gets the Chardonnay job done with some elegance.",87
,Cameron Hughes 2005 Lot 119 Meritage (Alexander Valley),"A very nice Bordeaux-style blend ready to drink now. It's soft, dry and complex, offering waves of blackberries, black currants, blueberries, cedar and herbs, wrapped into fine, rich tannins.",87
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Vino z Czech 2011 Welschriesling (Moravia),"Smoke and struck-flint notes add a dark tone to this savory, herb-inflected white wine. The palate is round and rich, and finishes with a reverberating hint of salt and bitter lemon rind.",85
Roger Voss,Wines & Winemakers 2012 Azul Portugal Escolha White (Vinho Verde),"Crisp. dry and fruity, this wine has a light touch of citrus and fresh acidity. Fruity with a slight sparkle, it's an ideal apéritif.",85
,Banshee Wines 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma County),"Sweet-pea and citrus flavors are pleasant, along with a welcome touch of creamy oak for richness. But there's also hints of green, unripe fruit in this dry, crisp Sauvignon Blanc.",85
Kerin O’Keefe,Bindi Sergardi 2010  Chianti Classico,"Oak dominates the overall character of this wine, with forward notes of toasted wood, tobacco leaf, roasted coffee bean and a hint of plum. There's more wood than fruit here.",85
Kerin O’Keefe,Corte alla Flora 2011  Rosso di Montepulciano,"Made from Sangiovese and a bit of Colorino, this has an earthy nose of truffle and underbrush, with a hint of iris and a whiff of leather. Reflecting the forward nature of the vintage, the palate is soft and warm, with sweet wild cherry, plum and round tannins. Drink soon.",85
Michael Schachner,Alpamanta 2009 Estate Malbec (Mendoza),"There's no denying the fact that this smells stalky and burnt, with leathery fruit aromas. In the mouth, it's choppy, with scratchy acidity leading to a loud flavor profile with stalky berry, raisin and stewed flavors. Heat and additional roasted notes drive the finish on this Malbec.",85
,Buena Vista 2011 The Count Founder's Red (Sonoma County),"This blend of undisclosed varieties is a charming red wine to drink now. It's dry, smooth and ripe in blackberry, cherry, currant and spice flavors. Beef is its natural partner.",85
Roger Voss,Domaine Robert Klingenfus 2010 Signature Pinot Noir (Alsace),"Light in color, this is a fruity, softly tannic and lightweight wine. It brings out red fruits that are now maturing, giving spice and a touch of pepper with final acidity. Drink now.",85
,Dominican Oaks 2010 Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"There is loads of freshly crushed black pepper in this dry, robust Zin. It's almost enough to make you sneeze. You'll also find good blackberry fruit and heady alcohol. Drink up.",85
Paul Gregutt,Emerson 2012 Viognier (Willamette Valley),"Light to the point of being a bit dilute, this Viognier has a cotton-candy character, like spun sugar around rhubarb. The tart, not quite fully ripe fruit brings it to a quick, acidic finish.",85
Kerin O’Keefe,Fattoria di Montecchio 2010  Chianti Classico,"This shows delicate floral aromas along with dominant bell pepper and sawdust sensations. The palate is dominated by oaky flavors of roasted coffee beans and espresso, giving the wine an anonymous personality and style.",85
Sean P. Sullivan,Girardet 2011 Chardonnay (Umpqua Valley),"Aged mostly in stainless steel with a touch of new French oak (10%), this has notes of toast and char along with freshly cut mango. It's on the lighter side of medium bodied, drinking just a hair off dry with a bitter note on the finish.",85
Michael Schachner,Lusco 2011 Albariño (Rías Baixas),"Albariño is a fragile style of white wine and some just don't age well. This is one of those wines; it's slightly past peak maturity, as evidenced by wheaty, yeasty aromas. The palate finishes with a hint of bitter citrus pith.",85
Michael Schachner,Damalisco 2008 Crianza  (Toro),"After opening with reedy, stalky aromas, this is raw and choppy on the palate. Flavors of herbal red plum and rhubarb conclude with tight, edgy acids and a bit of burn and heat. This is fresh and generally pretty good, but it lacks Toro's usual richness and power.",85
,Hill Wine Company 2010 Black Dog Series Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is a rustic but likeable wine. It's dry, tannic and full-bodied, with good varietal flavors of black currants, dark chocolate and sweet, smoky oak. Drink soon.",85
Kerin O’Keefe,Vignavecchia 2011  Chianti Classico,"From a very hot and difficult vintage, this Chianti Classico has unusual aromas of dill, thyme and toasted oak that carry over to the palate. It's already evolved with a short finish.",85
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Vino z Czech NV Cabernet Moravia (Moravia),"The Cabernet Moravia grape is a cross between Cabernet Franc and Zweigelt. Here, it incorporates all of Cab Franc's leafy herbaceousness and Zweigelt's tart, cranberry flavors in a refreshing wine. It's delicate in concentration, but easy drinking, with lots of green, grassy notes on the finish.",85
Virginie Boone,Martin Ranch 2011 J.D. Hurley Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Clara Valley),"This meaty, oaky Sauvignon Blanc, with a trace of Semillon, is slightly bitter with grassy and lemony aromas and flavors coming to the fore.",84
,Cameron Hughes 2010 Lot 362 Red (California),"A common, country-style wine, rich in cherries, cola and spices, with lusty tannins. It's lush and simple, but will rise to the occasion with a cheeseburger. The blend is Zinfandel, Petite Sirah and Graciano.",84
Michael Schachner,Casarena 2011 Estate Bottled Malbec (Mendoza),"This is exceedingly ripe tasting, with a syrupy texture. Along the way, you'll encounter tar and rubber aromas in front of flavors such as carob, vanilla and stewed berry fruits. A minty, oaky finish is the final weighty act.",84
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Ciringa 2011 Fosilni Breg Sauvignon Blanc (Slovenia),"Earthy with hints of roasted nuts and dried herb, this is a uniquely savory Sauvignon that would pair well with herb-accented fowl and fish. The palate is round and rich, but balanced with brisk lime acidity and a characteristic grassiness on the finish.",84
,La Calonica 2006  Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,"This deeply saturated wine opens with a nice balance of ripe, chewy fruit, vanilla and spice. The wine promises to evolve over time, giving more space to the mineral nuances you can already detect now. Tones of licorice, black spice and clove are lively and intense in the mouth.",90
Joe Czerwinski,Lingenfelder 2007 Freinsheimer Musikantenbuckel Kabinett Riesling (Pfalz),"An atypically light, delicate style of Riesling for the Pfalz, with lime and floral notes on the nose and a filigreed interplay of residual sugar and lithe acidity that lingers on the finish.",90
,Marchesi Antinori 2004 Pian delle Vigne  (Brunello di Montalcino),"Pian delle Vigne's 2004 Brunello is worlds apart from the scorching hot 2003 vintage—so different, in fact, the wine seems utterly reborn. You can smell those hallmark Sangiovese aromas: cherry, blue flower and wet earth, and taste the variety's elegant acidity.",90
,Mazzei 2007 Fonterutoli  (Chianti Classico),"Bold and modern, Fonterutoli delivers the goods year after year. The wine is rich and plush with deep concentration and excellent intensity. You'll get aromas of bright cherry and some spice but what makes the wine stand apart is the clarity and purity of its aromas.",90
,Novy 2006 Parsons' Vineyard Syrah (Russian River Valley),"Very ripe and extracted, just oozing the flavors of melted blackberry jam, black raspberry purée and milk chocolate. A bit sweet, but saved by firm tannins.",90
Paul Gregutt,Edmonds Winery 2007 Solstice Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"The fruit scents explode from the glass, showing raspberries, blueberries, cherries and plums in profusion. There is more stuffing, especially apparent in the nose and also in the mouth, than in the winery's varietal blends. The back end of the wine suggests bread and chocolate, light hints of toasted almond and cinnamon spice.",90
Joe Czerwinski,Fitz-Ritter 2006 Beerenauslese Rieslaner (Pfalz),"Verging on orange in color, this intensely botrytized wine from one of Germany's unique grape varieties is thick, almost chewy with extract and sugar. Dried apricot aromas lead into orange marmalade flavors with an almost burnt, caramelized quality. Finishes long, with a hint of bitterness that helps balance some of the intense sweetness.",90
Joe Czerwinski,Georg Mosbacher 2007 Forster Musenhang Spätlese Trocken Riesling (Pfalz),"Aromas of peach, lime and mineral make a first-rate initial impression, and are then followed by zesty citrus flavors that enhance rather than overpower the briny minerality. It's 13% alcohol, but maintains a wonderful balance of alcohol, acid and just a hint of sugar. Long and mouthwatering on the finish.",90
,Highlands 2006 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),"Compared to Highlands' regular Cab, this is a great example of sometimes, more is less. The '06 Reserve is a gigantic wine, both in ripely extracted currants and in the taste of new, smoky oak. But it's very size makes it ponderous. The question is one of ageability. It could well be a sleeper. Try beyond 2010.",90
Susan Kostrzewa,Vergelegen 2005 Mill Race Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Stellenbosch),"The nose has a ripe plum and savory spice character in this sophisticated red. On the palate, cedar, mocha and pepper give it a rich, brooding quality. Tannins are fine but ageable. The finish is lingering and spicy. Pair now with richer meat dishes; give it a few years to age and it will be even better.",90
Paul Gregutt,Arbor Crest 2006 Conner Lee Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This big, buttery Chardonnay will especially appeal to those who like California-style flavors; here enhanced with the firm acids characteristic of Washington State. There is a generous streak of vanilla cream, a soft and very buttery mouthfeel, yet the fruit has enough precision and focus that the wine does not lose definition. Delicious now, this is a wine to drink over the next three or four years.",90
,Cameron Hughes 2006 Lot 113 Syrah (Mount Veeder),"Negociant Hughes continues to produce compelling wines at everyday prices. This Syrah, from one of Napa Valley's best mountain regions, is dry and thick in refined tannins. But it's so rich in black currants, black cherries, chocolate, pepper and sweet, smoky oak that it's delicious now.",90
,Camigliano 2004  Brunello di Montalcino,"Liquid smoke, brimstone, tar, asphalt, licorice and mesquite follow dense aromas of black cherry, dried currants and mature plums. The wine is on the ripe, chewy side but ultimately finds balance thanks to its naturally firm tannins and fruity freshness.",90
Roger Voss,Château Dutruch Grand Poujeaux 2005  Moulis-en-Médoc,"Ripe, elegant wine, balancing fresh currant and red plum fruits against a mineral, dry structure. The acidity, the pure fruits and the solid tannins all work harmoniously together.",90
,Ciacci Piccolomini d'Aragona 2004  Brunello di Montalcino,"This is a vibrant and fresh Brunello that offers a thick layer of plush fruit backed by shadings of spice, leather and cola. The mouthfeel is succulent and chewy and the tannins give the wine dimension and backbone. Drink now through 2015.",90
,Crane Brothers 2005 Crane Ranch Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley),"Here's a strongly flavored Merlot, made with ultraripe fruit. If it didn't have a good structure, the blackberry, currant, mocha and anise flavors alone would make it a fruit bomb. Fortunately, fine acidity and gorgeously thick tannins give it structure and backbone. Best for a year or two.",90
Michael Schachner,García Figuero 2004 Tinto Figuero 15 Reserva  (Ribera del Duero),"One sniff announces a wood pile's worth of toasty, dusty oak. But there's all the bold Tempranillo fruit and classic RDD terroir here to absorb it. Ripe as can be on the palate, with equal parts mulled black fruit, spice and mocha. It finishes smooth, with generous extract but nothing grating or grabby. Drink now through 2012.",90
Joe Czerwinski,Geh. Rat Dr. von Bassermann-Jordan 2007 Forster Jesuitengarten Grosses Gewachs Trocken Riesling (Pfalz),"This broad, mouthfilling dry Riesling features powerful flavors of baked apple and dried spices, uplifted and amplified by oily, minerally accents. It's just a touch off-dry, balanced on the finish by crisp acids and pronounced minerality.",90
Joe Czerwinski,Georg Mosbacher 2007 Forster Elster Kabinett Trocken Riesling (Pfalz),"The relatively low residual sugar in this wine gives it a leaner feel than Mosbacher's other 2007s, but the fruit comes through as lime, grapefruit and passion fruit, marked by Forst's prominent minerality. Very crisp and long; would pair well with many seafood dishes.",90
Joe Czerwinski,Picardy 2006 Chardonnay (Pemberton),"From a little-known region of Western Australia, this is a restrained, structured example of Chardonnay that may drink well for 5–6 years. Subtle vanilla and bacon shadings upfront add nuance to the melon and pear aromas. Flavors are of soft, fully ripe tree fruit and melon, but held in check by citrusy notes and crisp acids.",90
,Tenimenti Angelini 2005 San Leonino Riserva  (Chianti Classico),"This is a great Chianti Classico Riserva that offers everything you look for in a wine from Tuscany. There's freshness and pristine cherry aromas along with spice, black mineral and fresh acidity on the close. The wine is approachable, soft and ultimately very food-friendly.",90
,Tenuta La Fuga 2004  Brunello di Montalcino,"One thing we've discovered about Tenuta La Fuga is that it performs evenly, year after year, despite climatic variations and extremes. That's a telltale sign of good winemaking and this Brunello delivers a sure bet to consumers thanks to its soft, supple mouthfeel and lingering aromas of succulent cherry and spice.",90
,Tiezzi 2004  Brunello di Montalcino,"Enzo Tiezzi has perfected his classic, traditional Brunello and delivers a tonic and fresh wine that would pair magically with hearty meat or pasta dishes that need to be broken down with extra acidity. On the nose, it shows aromas of sweet spice, almond, vanilla, caramel and wild berries.",90
,Trinchero 2005 Chicken Ranch Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"Ripe, fruity and delicious. Flatters with deep, long flavors of blackberries, black currants, cassis and cedar, with a lush, tannic mouthfeel and long finish. Nice now, and should develop beyond 2012.",90
,Borgo Scopeto 2005 Vigna Misciano Riserva  (Chianti Classico),"This modern vineyard-designate Riserva offers toasted notes of spice, nut and crème caramel. There are fruit notes in there too that are surrounded by mineral and earthy shadings. The mouthfeel is gritty, firm and persistent.",90
,Canalicchio Franco Pacenti 2004  Brunello di Montalcino,"Franco Pacenti makes excellent use of wood, resulting in a Brunello that shows fine balance between fruit and spice. The wine exhibits a slightly brownish hue but brings bright freshness and acidity to the table. Pair it with pasta or cheese risotto.",90
Roger Voss,Château de la Roulerie 2014 La Camélias  (Rosé de Loire),"Made 50/50 from Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvigon, this dry, orange-pink-colored wine has an appreciable amount of tannin as well as plenty of fruit. Acidity and ripe raspberries show strongly, as well as crisp final acidity. Drink now.",85
Roger Voss,Château la Croix de Roche 2013  Bordeaux Supérieur,"This wine has ripe red fruit flavors, a dry core, balanced tannins and plenty of acidity at the end. Drink now. The Maurin family's organic vineyards have all permitted grapes in Bordeaux, which is a good thing In a difficult vintage. This blend is Merlot (60%), Carmenère (15%), Petit Verdot (15%) and Malbec (10%).",85
Roger Voss,Château Les Hauts de Palette 2012  Côtes de Bordeaux,"This wine is structured although it does have plenty of ripe and full of berry fruits. Drink from 2017. The blend includes 50% Merlot, 40% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Cabernet Franc.",85
Roger Voss,Château Montlanderie 2013  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux,"This wine is light and fruity, well balanced with plenty of red berry flavors and only light tannins. It will be fresh and ready to drink from late 2016. The 30-acre vineyard on one of the appellation's highest spots was bought in 2009 by Denis Durantou, the owner of Château l'Église Clinet in Pomerol.",85
Roger Voss,Château Roc Montalon 2013  Bordeaux Supérieur,"With plenty of weight to support the ripe fruits, this is a balanced, perfumed wine. It has structure and tannins, along with fresh black currant flavors in the 80/20 Merlot/Cabernet Sauvignon blend. Drink from 2016.",85
Roger Voss,Château Saint-Pierre NV Saint-Pierre Rosé Brut Sparkling (Vin Mousseux),"This soft, gentle sparkling wine is fresh with raspberry fruits and acidity at the end. Drink as an apéritif.",85
Jim Gordon,Gnarly Head 2013 Authentic White (California),"Lemon and herb aromas suggest a lean, crisp wine but the flavors are fairly ripe and the texture is rich and soft. Appley, floral and not at all tart, this is pleasant to sip.",85
Sean P. Sullivan,14 Hands 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Washington),Light aromas of passion fruit and grapefruit are followed by tropical flavors that linger. It's an easy drinking quaffer.,85
Jim Gordon,Alias 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"Vivid plum and prune aromas and flavors define this generous and rather soft-textured wine. The fruit component is so rich it's jammy, and the tannins are very mild. The overall effect is grapy, almost sweet.",85
Jim Gordon,Angel's Cup 2013 Vineyard Selection Chardonnay (California),"This airy confection has aromas of lemon and vanilla, then almost sweet flavors of butterscotch and lemon cream on a fairly soft texture. It is light to medium bodied.",85
Kerin O’Keefe,Arbéta 2013  Barbera d'Alba Superiore,"Aromas of wet earth, leafy underbrush and dark berry lead the nose on this informal red. The simple palate is rather diluted but offers notes of dried black cherry, orange peel and nut alongside zesty acidity.",85
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Atwater 2013 Dry Riesling (Seneca Lake),"Hints of dusty mineral, nut and spice lend a savory tone to apple and pear in this cutting, crisp Riesling. It's honed and steely on the palate, finishing on a reverberating and bitter lime-zest note.",85
Michael Schachner,Balduzzi 2012 Grand Reserve Red (Maule Valley),"This blend is green and herbal up front. Following the nose, the palate is solid and chewy, but raw. Flavors of berry, olive and mixed spices are herbal, minty and green, while finishing notes of herbs, chocolate and heat fit the bill. This is 85% Cabernet Sauvignon, with Carmenère and Merlot.",85
Roger Voss,Cave de Saumur 2014 Les Pouches  (Saumur),"Attractive, simply fruity Chenin Blanc, this is a wine for drinking now. It is full of nutty flavors and apple acidity, with just a touch of minerality to give the wine some tension.",85
Matt Kettmann,Hawk Watch Winery 2012 Syrah (South Coast),"Lighter in color and body than many counterparts, this wine presents a sour blackberry and woody herb nose. Black olives, elderberries, cedar and black pepper beef flavors show on the gravelly palate.",85
Michael Schachner,La Purísima 2013 Alphabet Wines Monastrell (Yecla),"Scratchy aromas of red fruits register as raw, with a note of animal hide. This feels racy and wild, but lively. Briny, rugged flavors of raspberry and plum finish tart, with a pickled note that won't let go.",85
Sean P. Sullivan,Two Vines 2014 Gewürztraminer (Washington),"Reserved aromas of spice, pear and lychee are followed by medium-sweet flavors. Pair it with yellow curry.",85
Michael Schachner,Viña Casas Patronales 2012 Reserva Privada Cabernet Sauvignon (Maule Valley),"Earthy, woody aromas suggest oak, coconut and coffee, while an herbal, olive note is also present. This is a bit sharp and shearing in terms of acidity, but creamy vanilla flavors mellow the wine's racy plum and cherry character.",85
Virginie Boone,Ministry of the Vinterior 2013 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Low in oak and high in acidity, this wine skews tart and high-strung in terms of citrus and wet stone-like notions, offering a bouquet of lemon chiffon. A nice entry and finish surround a less-intriguing middle.",85
Michael Schachner,Montes 2012 La Finca Clos D'Angel Malbec (Colchagua Valley),"Jammy black-fruit aromas are woody, reduced and come across cheesy. A thick, tannic, oaky body is home to flavors of plastic, creamy oak, vanilla and charred berries. This is pasty, oaky and creamy on the finish.",85
Jim Gordon,One Leaf 2012 Chardonnay (California),"This doesn't taste true to the grape variety, but it's a good white wine with orange peel, jasmine and tangerine aromas, fairly quiet fruit flavors and then a floral, citrus finish. Light to medium bodied, it has an appetizing texture.",85
Sean P. Sullivan,Sagelands 2013 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Light aromas of herbs, woodspice, tire rubber and red fruit lead to jammy raspberry and spice flavors that provide easy drinking pleasure.",85
Michael Schachner,Santa Luz 2014 Reserva Encinos Malbec (Colchagua Valley),"Cola and berry aromas are jumpy. This feels tight and rubbery, but reasonably well focused. Standard plum and berry flavors are restrained, while the finish is fruity, with a clipped ending.",85
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Johnson Estate 2013 Freelings Creek Reserve Sparkling Traminette (Lake Erie),"Buoyantly aromatic, this blossomy Traminette sparkling wine stands out in a line up of traditional Champagne-style sparklers. Heady rose and gardenia tones feel perfumey on the palate, but brisk acidity and soft, pillowy foam are pleasant.",85

Roger Voss,Le Roi des Pierres 2014 Rosé (Sancerre),Fresh red fruits are smoothed out with caramel and spice flavors that give a ripe feel to this wine. It's light and ready to drink.,85
Jim Gordon,McFadden 2014 Blue Quail Pinot Gris (Potter Valley),"A rich texture and rather ripe fruit flavors make this softer and broader in taste than many of its peers. Flavors like Fuji apple and Bartlett pear are appealing, and the mouthfeel is smooth and easy rather than crisp.",85

Jim Gordon,Ardiri Winery and Vineyards 2012 Pinot Noir (California),"Made by an Oregon winery from Carneros region grapes, this wine tastes mellow and mature. It has a relatively light color with an auburn rim, aromas that are savory and meaty, flavors like rhubarb and beef, a fairly crisp balance and smooth texture.",85
Sean P. Sullivan,Canoe Ridge 2013 The Expedition Merlot (Horse Heaven Hills),"Herb, currant, vanilla and tire-rubber aromas are at the fore. The blackberry flavors drink off dry, sweetening toward the finish.",85

On the palate, black cherry and prune flavors are accompanied by bittersweet chocolate, vanilla and evident oak sensations. This is already evolved, so drink over the next year or two.",88
Michael Schachner,Valentin Bianchi 2010 Famiglia Bianchi Malbec (Mendoza),"Pencil eraser, iodine, latex and blueberry aromas settle better than they start. In the mouth, this is saturated and chunky in feel, with toasty flavors of blackberry, licorice and mint that finish long, herbal and loamy.",88
,Jefferson Vineyards 2008 Reserve Merlot (Monticello),"Enticing and idiosyncratic on the nose, this Merlot offers notes of rose petal, smoke, blood orange and caraway seed. The palate is medium bodied and the 13% alcohol gives it a sense of finesse. Fine but firm tannins frame the cherry fruit, and it finishes with hints of maduro and rose.",88
,Michael Pozzan 2011 Annabella Special Selection Chardonnay (Sonoma County-Napa County),"There's lots of rich Chardonnay character in this affordable wine. It's rich with vanilla, buttered toast, honey, orange and pineapple-jam flavors, with brisk acidity providing balance. Great price for a Chard this good.",88
,Ancient Oak Cellars 2010 Forty-Seven Friends Pinot Noir (Sonoma County),"This Pinot starts out tight, but after some time in the glass opens up to reveal black raspberry, mushroom, cola and exotic spice notes. It's dry, yet silky, in the mouth. A pretty wine, and for the price, a comparative bargain.",88
,Canihan 2009 Exuberance Syrah (Sonoma Valley),"Impressive for its power, a wine of considerable interest and complexity. It's rich in black cherries, red currants, cola, bacon and spice flavors, but the texture really stands up, a combination of firm tannins and brilliant acidity. Oak provides complicating notes of sweet toast. Drink soon.",88
Michael Schachner,Finca Albret 2009 Crianza Red (Navarra),"Everything about this lighter-framed Navarran blend is an echo of when European red wines were racy and crisp as opposed to big, extracted, dark and woody. With fresh raspberry aromas, zesty acidity and earthy flavors of red berry and spice offset by cocoa and vanilla, this is akin to Bordeaux and it should go nicely with most kinds of food.",88
Virginie Boone,Cline 2012 Ancient Vine Zinfandel (Contra Costa County),"Perfumed in cinnamon-flowery aromatics, this well-valued Zin is softly spiced, lush and smooth, drinkable with black cherry flavor and plenty of personality.",88
,Collection 35 2012 Rancho Arroyo Perdido Grüner Veltliner (Santa Barbara County),"This is the ideal anti-Chardonnay white wine. There's no oak at all to interfere with the lemon, lime and mineral flavors, and the acidity is brisk and mouthwatering. A dry, crisply brilliant wine to drink now with everything from sushi to tuna tartare.",88
Roger Voss,Domaines Devillard 2011 Château de Chamirey  (Mercurey),"Full-bodied wine with ripe pear and red apple flavors, laced with delicate acidity. It's an elegant wine, a fine balance with a more mineral, tight texture as a counterpoint. Drink from 2014.",88
Roger Voss,Domaines Devillard 2011 Château de Chamirey  (Mercurey),"A smooth and rounded wine, its ripe plum and blueberry flavors well integrated into the soft tannins and sweet acidity. Drinkable now, but worth waiting for two more years.",88
Roger Voss,Domaines Devillard 2011 Domaine de la Ferté Premier Cru Servoisine  (Givry),"Very dark, structured wine, with coffee as well as fruit flavors. The wood comes through firmly producing a solid, very dry character. The more juicy black currant fruits are still to show well. So wait to drink until 2015.",88
Kerin O’Keefe,Domenico Fraccaroli 2008 Grotta del Ninfeo  (Amarone della Valpolicella),"This Amarone is loaded with big fruit sensations of ripe cherry and plum, along with raisin, chocolate and oak accents. It's rather one dimensional, but has delicious fruit and is perfect for immediate enjoyment.",88
,Foyt Family 2009 No. 77 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mount Veeder),"Intensely concentrated in black currants, cassis liqueur and oak aromas and flavors, this Cabernet is so strong, it's practically undrinkable now. It's not just the potent tannins and bright acidity, it's the raw, jammy quality of the fruit. All these elements could begin to come together after 2017.",88
Roger Voss,Georges Vigouroux 2010 Château Tournelles Red (Buzet),"The small enclave of Buzet makes wines in a Bordeaux style, with black currant fruitiness and some firm tannins. This wine, now aging well, shows ripe juicy fruits, a solid dry core and refreshing, crisp acidity at the end.",88

Paul Gregutt,Scarborough 2010 The Main Event Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is the winery's Left-Bank-Bordeaux-style blend, three quarters Cabernet Sauvignon. It has a pleasing mix of red and black fruits, licorice, toast and smoke, and spent two and a half years in French oak, 60% new. The wine is quite tasty and drinking well, though the blend lacks focus.",88
Roger Voss,Signé Vigneron 2012 Domaine de la Croix Rouge  (Juliénas),"A rich wine, full of black fruits, ripe tannins and juicy acidity. It's powerful and structured, showing a mineral texture, bold acidity and ample fruitiness.",88
Kerin O’Keefe,Trabucchi d'Illasi 2007  Amarone della Valpolicella,"This opens with funky but not unpleasant aromas that soon burn off to reveal earthy notes and mature black fruit. The palate shows a very ripe—almost overripe—blackberry flavor, with mushroom and tobacco leaf accents. While the ripe fruit still has immediate appeal, this is getting tired, so drink soon.",88
Paul Gregutt,Hogue 2012 Late Harvest Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Don't let the label mislead you; this is not a dessert wine. It's off-dry, with a pretty suite of lemon, orange and citrus peel flavors. A whiff of tea runs through the aromas, and a bit of lemon oil in the finish.",88
Roger Voss,Kuentz-Bas 2011 Tradition Riesling (Alsace),"A delicate, crisp, very pure wine. It has perfumes of white flowers, which continue with the addition of ripe pear and lime. Crisp at the end, for drinking now, but also keep until 2017.",88
Roger Voss,Lionel Osmin & Cie 2012 Red (Gaillac),"Smooth and soft, this is a warm wine, showing richness as well as a lightly rustic character that will disappear as the wine ages. It has fine tannins, layered with crisp acidity and a stalky, spicy texture. Drink now or keep until 2016.",88
Kerin O’Keefe,Manara 2010 Le Morete  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso),"Here's a bright and delicious ripasso, loaded with notes of black cherry, exotic spice, white pepper and a hint of bitter almond.

Kerin O’Keefe,Mario Schiopetto 2011 Blanc des Rosis White (Collio),"Made from Friulano, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon, Malvasia and Ribolla Gialla, this blend represents the major white varieties in Friuli. It offers aromas of Spanish broom and lemon drop, with apricot and mineral flavors that finish long and clean.",88
Paul Gregutt,Mercer 2010 Cavalie Reserve Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The top cuvée from Mercer Estates, this reserve is a Bordeaux-style blend based upon 64% Merlot, the rest a mix of Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Petit Verdot. A firm entry introduces a solid mid-palate with a mix of black fruits, coffee and toast. The finish is clean and gentle, with moderate persistence.",88
Kerin O’Keefe,Montecariano 2009  Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso,"This offers aromas of mature black fruit and raisin. The palate delivers a vibrant black-cherry core, layered with accents of black pepper and Asian spice. It also has fresh acidity for the vintage, and will pair well with buttery dishes or cured meats.",88
Paul Gregutt,Airfield Estates 2012 Unoaked Chardonnay (Yakima Valley),"This young, stainless steel-fermented Chardonnay has a beery hoppiness to the aromas, leading into a tart, juicy and crisp palate of lime and grapefruit. The acids taste of wet stone, and that vivid minerality brings dimension and lift to the finish.",88
Kerin O’Keefe,Antica Corte 2010  Amarone della Valpolicella,"This is an unfettered but very enjoyable Amarone, with upfront aromas of black fruit. The palate shows ripe but not exuberant plum and prune flavors, with a hint of chocolate. Pair with seasoned cheeses or braised meat dishes.",88
Carrie Dykes,Fabbioli Cellars 2013 Chambourcin (Virginia),"This wine is abundant with aromas of cherry Coke, sarsaparilla and baking spice. The palate is delicate yet is given some weight from seven months in neutral French and American oak. This wine gains a soft texture from Tannat skins added during fermentation.",87
Fiona Adams,Biltmore Estate NV Blanc de Noir Brut Sparkling (America),"This neon-watermelon sparkler shows playfully fruity aromas of watermelon hard candy and fresh strawberries. Ample acidity keeps the palate lively, with ripe watermelon, cherry and strawberry flavors carrying through to the bright finish.",87
Roger Voss,Casa de Vilacetinho 2016 Avesso & Azal White (Vinho Verde),"This is the lightest in a series of wines featuring the Avesso grape. Herbal, crisp and with plenty of acidity, it's also fruity and ready to drink.",87
Roger Voss,Casa Santos Lima 2015 Fortissimo Red (Alentejano),"Smooth red-berry fruits give this wine a glow of ripeness. The blend of Touriga Nacional, Syrah and Alicante Bouschet is dense and full of dark berries, with a touch of wood aging to smooth everything out. Drink now.",87
Roger Voss,Caves Transmontanas 2013 Vertice Grande Reserva Red (Douro),"This densely tannic wine is bold and linear, with concentrated chocolate and spice flavors. Rich black fruits are layered with acidity and a tight, mineral texture. Still firm, the wine is not likely to soften more, so drink now.",87
Roger Voss,Caves Velhas 2014 D. Fuas Reserva Red (Terras do Dão),"This wine comes from vineyards outside the boundaries of the Dão region but has the same typical blend. It shows minerality as well as rich fruit and soft tannins. The wine is balanced, stylish and deliciously ready to drink.",87

Michael Schachner,Domaine Bousquet 2016 Finca Lalande Malbec (Mendoza),"Racy plum and cherry aromas lead to an edgy palate with bold acidity. Crisp, foxy flavors of raspberry and plum finish spicy and with pronounced acidity. This wine emphasizes acidity and freshness over ripeness and heft.",87
Roger Voss,Domaine Campu Vecchiu 2016 Rosé (Corse),"This wine comes from a large family-owned estate on the island's east coast. It's loaded with bright fruit, crisp acidity and a rounded, ripe red berry-inflected aftertaste. Drink now.",87
Roger Voss,Domaine Girard 2016 Benoît Girard  (Sancerre),"This has a soft texture that just allows room for some crisp apple flavors. Otherwise, it is a smooth rounded wine. Its fruitiness and its acidity are part and parcel of this ripe wine. Drink now.",87
Roger Voss,Domaine les Hautes Noëlles 2016 Les Parcelles Sur Lie  (Muscadet Côtes de Grandlieu),"This is all light fruit and crisp acidity. Bright and light, brimming with citrus and apples, the wine is ready to drink. It comes from the western end of the Muscadet vineyards near the Lac de Grand-Lieu.",87
Roger Voss,Quinta da Ribeirinha 2015 Ardósia Tinto Red (Tejo),"Made to drink young, this fruity, softly structured wine is ripe with blackberry fruits. There is a touch of spice from the wood aging and a lining of attractive acidity. Drink now.",87
Roger Voss,Quinta de Porrais 2015 Porrais Red (Douro),"The quinta for this wine is on the plateau north of the Douro river. It has produced a red-fruit wine, rich with soft tannins and juicy fruitiness. The wood aging is already well integrated into this bold, ripe wine. Drink now.",87

Paul Gregutt,Ransom 2013 Selection Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"This late release sourced from several vineyards dating back to the 1970s and 1980s is thin on the palate, with tart plum, herb, orange peel and of pineapple hints. Low alcohol reflects the cool vintage.",87

Roger Voss,Rui Roboredo Madeira 2016 Castello d'Alba Branco White (Douro),"From vines grown in the upper Douro Superior, this is crisp while also having ripe apple and apricot fruitiness. It is a lively wine, tangy with orange zest and a touch of spice. Drink now.",87
Roger Voss,Secret Spot Wines 2016 Vale da Poupa Rosé (Douro),"This ripe, full-bodied rosé is made from 100% rich, perfumed Touriga Nacional. Good balance between ripe strawberry fruits and the crisp acidity make it both fruity and warm. Drink now.",87
Paul Gregutt,Simple Machine 2013 Leverage White (Rogue Valley),"Made in the style of a southern Rhône blend (half Viognier and one quarter each Marsanne and Roussanne), this is lightly lemony, with a bit more fat in the middle. None of the three grapes overpowers the others, but the flavors feel a bit generic. Though fermented in stainless steel, it's gold in color and shows some hints of toast.",87
Joe Czerwinski,Ten Sisters 2015 Pinot Noir (Marlborough),"This medium-bodied wine features a heavy dose of baking spices and vanilla layered atop notions of earth and red cherries. It's a little dry and woody, but cinnamon and clove notes add charm.",87
Kerin O’Keefe,Tenuta Rapitalà 2016 Campo Reale Nero d'Avola (Sicilia),"This early-drinking Nero d'Avola opens with ripe black-skinned fruit, tilled soil and cooking spice aromas. Straightforward and savory, it delivers black cherry, blackberry and ground pepper flavors alongside round tannins.",87
Virginie Boone,Uptick Vineyards 2014 Estate Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Exceptionally light, this acid-driven wine is all flowers and green apple, with just the slightest reach out to honeycomb-like texture and weight. It'll do well at the table in its unfussy approach and crispness.",87

Joe Czerwinski,Dashwood 2015 Pinot Noir (Marlborough),"This wine's aromas are marked by bright cherries and an undercurrent of button mushrooms. It's medium bodied and crisp, with just enough silky-textured tannin to give it some grip. Drink now.",87
Fiona Adams,Gruet 2011 Sauvage Sparkling (America),"Made from 100% Chardonnay, this shows lemon, apple and nectarine on the nose with hints of croisant.

,Tasca d'Almerita 2011 Sallier de la Tour Grillo (Sicilia),"There's a touch of toasted almond at the start, but then this Grillo revs up in the glass to deliver notes of citrus, stone fruit, crushed stone and lemon tart. The mouthfeel is crisp and simple.",85
Michael Schachner,Tres Palacios 2011 Reserve Pinot Noir (Maipo Valley),"Lightly herbal strawberry and raspberry aromas are authentic and fresh. On the palate, this is light and juicy, with snappy, lean flavors of red fruit and dry spice. The finish is dry and oaky.",85
,Torrevento 2009 Torre del Falco Nero di Troia (Murgia),"Aged for 10 months in stainless steel in order to maintain simple, clean lines, this Nero di Troia opens with a spicy tone of black pepper, backed by ripe blackberry and prune notes. There's a touch of bright acidity on the finish.",85
,Cantine di Dolianova 2010 Dolia  (Monica di Sardegna),"The Monica grape often shows a rustic or raw quality, with aromas of cherry cola, black pepper and sour fruit. This expression does just that, with an added touch of bright acidity on the finish.",85
Roger Voss,Château de Sours 2011 La Fleur d'Amélie  (Bordeaux Blanc),"Fruity and lightly herbaceous, this has fine textured acidity along with a pink grapefruit flavor. The wine is bright and easy, and it will be ready to drink in a few months.",85

Michael Schachner,Arboleda 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Aconcagua Valley),"This is a prickly wine, with a strong blast of nettle and green herb aromas. It has weight and texture on the palate, while the flavors of citrus fruits and salad greens are pithy and mildly bitter. Green and white pepper notes dominate the finish.",85
,Arrowood 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),"Rich and substantial, this is potent in blackberry, cassis and dark chocolate flavors. High alcohol gives it a hot mouthfeel. It's not really representative of the Arrowood name of old.",85
,Bonavita 2009  Faro,"Dark and inky, this natural wine is made from organic fruit, and it offers aromas of cured beef and prune, followed by accents of tobacco and wet earth. There's not much fruit, and it shows slightly bitter tannins on the close.",85
Roger Voss,Château de Pizay 2011 Rosé d'Une Nuit Gamay (Beaujolais Rosé),"This tastes bone dry, with a caramel note that's followed by light, bright notes of red berry and apple. The finish is crisp and tight.",85
Roger Voss,Château Marac 2010  Bordeaux Supérieur,"From an estate in the Entre-Deux-Mers region, this wine is firm and concentrated, packed with ripe tannins and juicy blackberry fruit. Dense, with dusty tannins, it is smooth and polished in texture.",85
Paul Gregutt,Chehalem 2011 Stoller Vineyards Pinot Blanc (Dundee Hills),"Tart and dry, this has a broad flavor that does not express much varietal specificity, with some notes of caramel and butter. Not yet knit together, this could improve significantly with further bottle age.",85
Michael Schachner,Cono Sur 2010 Visión El Recurso Single Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),"Leather, cheese, licorice, herb and tomato notes define the nose on this snappy, crisp Cabernet that's more racy and zesty than rich and deep. The finish is wiry, but overall the wine is short on richness.",85

Paul Gregutt,Erath 2010 Dion Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"The Dion is a new entry in the long list of Erath single-vineyard wines. It doesn't show much in this difficult vintage. Short and intensely herbal, it has strong scents and flavors of tomato leaf, which override any hint of ripe fruit flavor.",85
Paul Gregutt,Erath 2011 Dion Vineyard Rosé Pinot Gris (Chehalem Mountains),"It's difficult to understand what this is trying to be. Pinot Gris can show some light blush color, but this wine is almost pink. The result is tannic and tart, with a rhubarb-like flavor.",85
Roger Voss,Georges Duboeuf 2012 Nouveau  (Beaujolais),"This has surprisingly structured fruits and firm tannins for a Nouveau, and it still maintains a juicy cherry flavor and ripe acidity. The finish has a tangy, textured character.",85

Michael Schachner,Lomas del Valle 2011 Coastal Cool Climate Merlot (Casablanca Valley),"This starts out fresh on the nose, with a modest herbal accent. The palate is lively and clean, with ample body and good balance. Flavors of cherry, plum and herb lead to a mildly green-tasting finish.",85

Roger Voss,Pratsch 2009 Erdpress Red (Niederösterreich),"A blend of St. Laurent and Pinot Noir, this is a full, round wine. It has a soft, juicy texture that comes with a touch of barnyard as well as warm strawberry fruit. The finish is rich, and the wine is ready to drink.",85
Kerin O’Keefe,Di Filippo 2012  Montefalco Rosso,"Made with organically farmed grapes, this blend of 60% Sangiovese, 30% Barbera and 10% Sagrantino opens with aromas of tilled earth, blue flower, ripe berry and spice. The dense palate doles out fleshy black cherry, crushed plum, black pepper and tobacco alongside firm but velvety tannins. It finishes on a succulent note.",90
Virginie Boone,Domaine Carneros 2012 Clonal Series Swan Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Soft and sexy, this small-production Pinot is made from Swan-clone grapes exclusively, which provides an intriguing spiciness to the wine.

Matt Kettmann,J. Lohr 2013 Flume Crossing Sauvignon Blanc (Arroyo Seco),"This very approachable and likable wine puts the typical dried-grass aromas atop stone fruit scents.

Virginie Boone,Jamieson Ranch 2012 Double Lariat Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Supple and accessible, this Cabernet is bright in acidity and soft in tannins, yet amply structured. The palate is layered with flavors of cherry and cranberry, with a hit of nuanced oak on the finish.",90
Paul Gregutt,Knudsen 2012 Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"This is the first vintage made by the vineyard owners in 25 years, a welcome return for one of the founding families of Oregon viticulture. Strawberries and raspberries, tart and spicy, anchor an elegant and interesting young wine. The finish continues clean and well-defined. Don't look for a blockbuster style; rather it's more delicate and refined.",90
Virginie Boone,Buena Vista 2012 Private Reserve Pinot Noir (Sonoma County),"There's an earthy intensity to this reserve wine, generous in oak and cedar notes with complicated, concentrated mix of plum, cherry and berry. Nonetheless, the wine intrigues and delights.",90
Kerin O’Keefe,Cantina della Volta 2010 Rosé Metodo Classico  (Lambrusco di Modena),"Elegant yet extremely accessible, this presents aromas of bright red berry, clove and a whiff of baked bread. The savory palate offers crushed raspberry, wild strawberry, toasted hazelnut and cinnamon alongside a soft mousse and fresh acidity. Panebianco, Golden State Wine.",90

Kerin O’Keefe,Romanelli 2010  Montefalco Sagrantino,"Underbrush, forest floor, crushed violet, new leather, mature plum and graphite aromas lead the nose on this brawny red. The hearty palate delivers dried black cherry, blackberry, nutmeg, grilled sage and licorice alongside youthfully aggressive but ripe tannins. Drink 2015–2025.",90
Kerin O’Keefe,Principe Pallavicini 2012 Amarasco Cesanese (Lazio),"Made from old vines of Cesanese, this structured red offers an intriguing fragrance of violets, rose, red berry, scorched earth and a whiff of nutmeg. The bright, juicy palate delivers wild cherry, orange peel, clove and baking spice alongside supple, smooth tannins.",90
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Red Newt Cellars 2013 Circle Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Lithe and dancing in texture, yet robustly concentrated with yellow peach and cherry flavors, Red Newt's Circle delivers great quality for a gentle price, vintage after vintage.

Kerin O’Keefe,Ruffino 2010 Greppone Mazzi  (Brunello di Montalcino),"Pretty aromas of red berry, menthol, savory herb and cooking spice lead the nose. The palate offers tart red cherry, white pepper and Mediterranean herb alongside firm, refined tannins and bright acidity. It needs time to develop fully. Drink 2017–2022.",90
Jim Gordon,Sanglier Cellars 2012 Left Tusque Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"Serious and concentrated, this is a big and bold wine packed with ripe fruit flavors and firm tannins.

Matt Kettmann,Sextant 2012 Caverio G-S-M (Paso Robles),"Cola, dark red fruit, black pepper and oak greet the nose on this blend of 77% Grenache, 19% Syrah and 4% Mourvèdre.

Sean P. Sullivan,Thurston Wolfe 2010 The Geologist Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wine is a blend of Upland Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (50%), Double Canyon Petit Verdot (38%) and McKinley Springs Malbec. It's aromatically reserved, revealing fresh and dried herbs, green pepper, vanilla, cocoa and dark cherry. The dark fruit flavors show a very pretty combination of richness and restraint.",90
Sean P. Sullivan,Two Mountain 2012 Copeland Vineyard Syrah (Yakima Valley),"You'd swear this 100% varietal wine had some Viognier in it, but the orange-peel aromas and flavors are just a hallmark of Yakima Valley fruit. It also features abundant cranberry, mulberry, rose hip and savory notes. The supple feel with light meat accents is where this wine really shines, showing purity, texture and a lot of elegance. Those looking for big fruit, look elsewhere.",90
Sean P. Sullivan,14 Hands 2011 The Reserve Merlot (Horse Heaven Hills),"Aged for 30 months in French and American oak (90% new), this wine brings pleasing notes of café au lait, pencil lead, cashew and woodspice. Rich coffee and chocolate flavors are backed by a silky feel, with the wood playing prominent role.",90
Jim Gordon,Alder Springs 2013 Signature Chardonnay (Mendocino),"Like a lemon-cream pastry in a bottle, this low-yield, hillside-grown wine has buttery, creamy aromas, rich almond and bright lemon flavors and a soft, nearly sweet finish. Not too full-bodied, it's a bit lighter in texture than many, because of that fresh lemony acidity to buoy it up.",90
Jim Gordon,Andis 2011 Goedeck-Liu Vineyard Meritage (Sierra Foothills),"This strikes a good balance between spicy oak, fruitiness and firm texture. It smells lightly spicy from oak barrels, and also fresh like red cherry and sweet plums. Rich and layered in feel, it finishes dry and full bodied. Not overblown, it has just the right mix of elements for the dinner table.",90
Jim Gordon,Borra 2012 Markus Nimmo White (California),"This energized white wine has a German accent. Aromas recall honey, honeysuckle, tart apple and pineapple, and the flavors are like orange zest—tart, crisp and slightly bitter in a good way. This blend of Kerner, Gewürztraminer, Riesling and Bacchus grapes should be brilliant with rich shellfish. It was barrel-fermented in 60% new oak, which one can't so much taste as feel subtly.",90
Kerin O’Keefe,Capanne Ricci 2010  Brunello di Montalcino,"Floral scents of rose and violet also convey red berry, Mediterranean scrub and peppermint camphor.

Roger Voss,Château Laforge 2012  Saint-Émilion,"This very complete wine offers dark tannins, ripe berry fruits and a velvet texture. It's rich, relying on blackberry and black plum flavors and a dense structure. Mouth-filling, it delivers delicious fragrant acidity at the end. Drink from 2017.",90
Roger Voss,Château Larrivaux 2011  Haut-Médoc,"From the northern end of the Haut-Médoc region, close to Saint-Estèphe, this dark-hued wine is still very structured.

Roger Voss,Château Picque Caillou 2012  Pessac-Léognan,"Big structure underlies this wine, very firm and dark. It has layers of dry tannins, big fruit and concentrated structure.

Roger Voss,Château Rollan de By 2012  Médoc,"Big, firm tannins dominate this structured wine. New wood aging shows, giving a very dry feeling. It's also rich and full in the mouth, packed with ripe black plum and berry flavors. It's going to balance well and richly. Drink from 2018.",90
Roger Voss,Château Teyssier 2012  Montagne-Saint-Émilion,"New wood shows strongly in this perfumed, Merlot-dominated wine. It is structured and still very tight and tannic at this stage.

Roger Voss,Château Tour de Pez 2012  Saint-Estèphe,"The small area of Pez is one of the top sites in Saint-Estèphe, with many highly rated chateaus. This is one.

The future is good for this wine, so drink from 2018.",90
Kerin O’Keefe,Collosorbo 2009 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),"Aromas of stewed fruit, prune and hay lead the nose on this brawny wine. The savory but monolithic palate offers dried cherry, fig, licorice and tobacco alongside velvety tannins. Drink through 2018.",90
Michael Schachner,Delgado Zuleta NV Premium Fino Sherry (Jerez),"Intense, nutty, yeasty aromas are briny and a touch creamy. This has a tight, pure, round palate with salty nectarine, apricot and nut flavors. Walnut oil and white pepper notes grace a direct, lively finish.",90

Iijima,Heron Hill 2011 Eclipse Red (New York),"Deftly calibrating sultry black fruit against savory earth tones, this blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc offers refinement.

Jim Gordon,McGrail 2011 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley),"Extra dark in color, this has equally attention-getting dark chocolate and espresso aromas, rich black currant and blackberry flavors, and a firm, generously tannic texture. Although tempting to drink now, this will improve in complexity and smoothness through 2017.",90
Matt Kettmann,Mesa Del Sol 2010 Zinfandel (Arroyo Seco),"This vineyard near the confluence of the Salinas and Carmel valleys is producing strong wines, in this case one offering aromas of roasted game, smoked blueberries and cracked slate.

Sean P. Sullivan,Airfield Estates 2012 Merlot (Yakima Valley),"Cocoa, toast, vanilla, cigar box, coconut and raspberry aromas lead the way on this 100% varietal wine. The palate is full of dark fruit flavors with slightly gritty tannins and tart acids. Give it some time to come together.",88

Michael Schachner,Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite) 2014 Los Vascos Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley),"Aromas of cherry and currant are a bit flat.

Sean P. Sullivan,Finn Hill 2012 Bon Mot Cabernet Franc (Wahluke Slope),"The aromas offer barrel spices, toast, black licorice and red fruit while the palate brings dark fruit flavors with a grainy feel. The oak (100% new French) juts out a bit and overrides the fruit.",88

Michael Schachner,Koyle 2013 Gran Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley),"A strong blast of oak and wood shavings are up front and on top of the nose on this chunky Cabernet.

Matt Kettmann,Lone Madrone 2012 Barbera (Paso Robles),"A fairly uncommon grape for the entire Central Coast, this bottling offers squeezed blueberry and dark purple fruit aromas bolstered by black pepper and black rocks. Lighter in body than expected upon the sip, the palate shows cola, bright cranberry juice and a sandalwood spice that makes it very easy to drink.",88
Anna Lee C. Iijima,McGregor 2014 Semi Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Sunny, peachy sweetness abounds in this light-footed Riesling. Off dry in style, it's breathlessly fresh and fruity, yet intensified by shimmering lime and mineral tones. Drink now for its youthful effervescence.",88

Paul Gregutt,Trisaetum 2013 Estates Reserve Riesling (Willamette Valley),"Sourced from the best barrels made at the winery in 2013, this off-dry reserve checks in with roughly 30 g/L residual sugar, and plenty of acidity to more than balance it out.

Kerin O’Keefe,Le Strette 2010 Bergera Pezzole  (Barolo),"Aromas of red rose, wild cherry, forest floor and a whiff of leather take center stage.

Joe Czerwinski,Torbreck 2010 RunRig Shiraz-Viognier (Barossa Valley),"A perplexing wine to evaluate, the 2010 RunRig (97% Shiraz and 3% Viognier) evolves rapidly once poured, going from slightly stewed and overoaked to a wine that shows considerable class within 20 minutes or so.

Red currant, clove, cedar and pencil all appear around a full-bodied, leathery texture and dots of black pepper and sage.",89
Anne Krebiehl MW,Nastl 2015 Klassik Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),"Only very slight citrus notes appear on the nose.

Anne Krebiehl MW,Nigl 2015 Gelber Muskateller (Niederösterreich),"Hints of white blossom mix with faint notes of pear to create a delicately balanced, fresh and spring-like wine that is as light as gossamer.

Crisp red currant and plum dance around savory specks of cedar and toasty oak.",89
Michael Schachner,Proelio 2012 Crianza  (Rioja),"Wiry cherry and herb aromas are fresh and reedy. This Rioja feels crisp and mildly astringent. Quick, punchy flavors of plum and wild berry fruits turn more oaky prior to a finish that's fresh and forward, with hard tannins. Drink through 2021.",89
Joe Czerwinski,Quartz Reef 2013 Bendigo Single Vineyard Pinot Noir (Central Otago),"At this early stage, the oak is still prominent.

Drink soon to enjoy its vividness.",89

The mouthfeel is creamy and velvety, with plush tannins and lingering baking-spice flavors.",89
Virginie Boone,Gibbs 2012 Crossed Paths Dusty Red (Napa Valley),"Nearly equal parts Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this dusty red also makes use of 26% Syrah, 3% Cabernet Sauvignon and 3% unidentified as other. A straightforward wine, it's juicy in blackberry and chalky chocolate.",89

Jim Gordon,Apriori 2014 Chardonnay (Mendocino),"A very interesting wine, this is reserved but complex, not overtly fruity or buttery, but more intriguing than that. It smells lightly like lemon zest and hazelnuts, and tastes quietly concentrated, like peach skin and almonds.",89
Roger Voss,Bernard Magrez 2015 Les Muraires Douce Vie Rosé (Côtes de Provence),"Grown inland, away from the sea's influence, this wine has a full-bodied character. Acidity cuts through the ripe red fruits and caramel and spice flavor. The wine is rich and full in the mouth, soft at the end.",89

Anne Krebiehl MW,The Dot 2014 Austrian Plum St. Laurent (Niederösterreich),"Vivid pepper and rounded red plum notes are joined by hints of cinnamon—reminiscent of freshly baked plum tart. This is a soft, pliable but very full-fruited wine. Lovers of Pinot should definitely try St. Laurent—here it is in a very approacheble and supercharming, medium-bodied red.",89
Michael Schachner,Ramón Bilbao 2015 Albariño (Rías Baixas),"Apple and melon aromas are clean, stony and direct. This feels juicy while also offering ample body weight. Tangerine and nectarine flavors finish long, minerally and ripe, with none of Albariño's common pithy bitterness.",89
Michael Schachner,Salcis 2010 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero),"Stewy berry and melted chocolate aromas are ultra oaky and creamy. A tannic, heavy mouthfeel and borderline overripe flavors of prune, chocolate and tobacco finish raisiny and baked. Drink through 2020.",89
Matt Kettmann,San Simeon 2012 St. Eva Hill Vineyard Petite Sirah (Paso Robles),"A single vineyard expression from this winery's newish vineyard, this shows pressed purple flowers, deep blueberries and a touch of tar on the nose.

Michael Schachner,Terrazas de Los Andes 2013 Reserva Malbec (Mendoza),"Strapping currant and berry aromas come with a full dosage of toasty oak. This Malbec feels sinewy, with good depth.

Matt Kettmann,Barton 2014 The River White (Central Coast),"Sharp aromas of peach blossoms, honeyed nuts and lemon balm make for a fruity yet biting nose on this blend of 58% Grenache Blanc from Happy Canyon and 42% Viognier from San Luis Obispo County. Ripened stonefruit flavors are cut with a sizzle of acidity and warmth of sea salt and candied Meyer lemon on the palate.",89
Virginie Boone,Brick & Mortar 2013 La Perla Vineyard Pinot Noir (Spring Mountain District),"A clear, light-bodied wine that's slightly reduced on the nose, this Spring Mountain site provides a tightness of black tea and cherry cola, with a leanness that's hard to miss. Leather, currant and baked bread add additional complexity and intrigue.",89
Virginie Boone,One 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Yountville),"A 100% varietal wine entirely from Yountville, this presents a touch of herb and cedar on the entry aromatically, followed by a thickness of tannin that softens in the glass. Big-boned, it finishes strong in tobacco and coffee.",89
Matt Kettmann,Pace 2013 Sebastiano Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Simultaneously light yet earthy, this shows cherry pie, concentrated pomegranate, whole nutmeg, buttery crust and intriguing brown spices on the nose. There is a bit less action on the palate, but still plenty of tart cherries, tobacco and brown spice elements.",89
Matt Kettmann,Jason-Stephens 2010 Estate Merlot (Santa Clara Valley),"Blueberry, grapeseed, leather, cigar box and concentrated lavender combine for an elegantly intriguing nose on this bottling from a winery between Morgan Hill and Gilroy. The palate is fresh and rather light, with plums, figs, crushed peppercorns and a forest floor/pine needle intrigue.",89
Jim Gordon,Las Positas 2014 Estate Rosé (Livermore Valley),"Fresh and tempting, this has a hot-pink color and flavors like watermelon and cherry. With medium body and even a light touch of tannin, it's more meaty than many rosés, so you can serve it with the meal as well as for an apéritif.",89
Virginie Boone,In Re 2010 You be the judge! Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Sanguine in cedar, pencil lead and tea, this wine's elegant opening gives way to ripe black fruit and thick, burly tannins. The finish is marked in vanilla oak and a taste of cigar.",89
Joe Czerwinski,Waipara Hills 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"This is a bold, assertive Sauvignon Blanc, boasting bright citrus aromas and flavors, lifted by just a sprinkling of cut grass. A bit of creaminess adds dimension on the palate, which then finishes on a burst of lime and grapefruit.",89
Matt Kettmann,Two Moons 2013 Aporia White (Paso Robles),"Lightly smoked stone fruit and apple blossoms greet the nose on this bottling of 50% Marsanne and 50% Grenache Blanc. The palate is much more interesting, with lemon sorbet and ripe apples clinging to a steely centerline that shows flashes of flint and gunmetal.",89
Kerin O’Keefe,Valle dell'Acate 2012  Cerasuolo di Vittoria Classico,"Aromas of ripe berry, Mediterranean herb, menthol and eucalyptus lead the nose. The medium-bodied palate is already somewhat evolved offering blackberry extract, mature black cherry, licorice, spice and espresso alongside polished tannins. It closes on a note of bitter walnut.",89
Matt Kettmann,Volatus 2008 Reserve Red (Paso Robles),"This long-aged blend of 67% Syrah and 33% Petite Sirah is plump on the oaky nose with condensed rose petal, chocolate cake and violet aromas. The palate starts with ripe black cherries but then settles into an asphalt-laden midpalate, finishing with chocolate-chip cookies and a graphite tension.",89
Matt Kettmann,Zocker 2014 Paragon Vineyard Grüner Veltliner (Edna Valley),"Playful and nearly effervescent on the nose with lemon-lime soda notes and a sparkling pear-cider character, this bottling also shows aromas of pink grapefruit and pink lemonade sorbet. Tart lime and lemon verbena pop on the palate as does melon pith, with a slight herbal character on the finish.",89
Anne Krebiehl MW,Hannes Reeh 2014 Rohstoff Chardonnay (Burgenland),"There is a high-toned aspect to the otherwise neutral nose that just gives away lemony hints. The palate is sprightly and fresh and reveals a very creamy, fruity, almost tropical core which is cut very pleasantly by fresh, aromatic lemon—this is Chardonnay but not as you know it. A very fruity, rich but fresh number.",89
Sean P. Sullivan,Hightower 2012 Reserve Red (Red Mountain),"This wine could be labeled a Cabernet Sauvignon, which makes up 83% of the blend, with the rest Merlot. The aromas of fruit leather, dried blackberry, black licorice and medicine cabinet are bright, though they seem considerably more evolved than the wine's age might indicate. The black-fruit flavors display a sense of balance that carries through the finish. Drink now.",89
Sean P. Sullivan,Full Pull & Friends 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Already six years old, this wine offers aromas of black licorice, dried cherry, vanilla, clove and abundant wood spices. The flavors of black fruit, licorice and barrel spice intertwine and carry through the finish. The wood is a bit out front at times but the wine still delivers a lot of enjoyment.",89
Sean P. Sullivan,Gamache 2011 Estate Grown Malbec (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Aromas of blue and purple fruit mix with notes of dried thyme and black pepper. The flavors are tart and elegant, showing a good sense of balance and restraint, with a finish that lingers.",89
Sean P. Sullivan,Genoa 2012 Flying Colors Super Tuscan-Style Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Half Cabernet with the rest Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Mourvèdre and Petit Verdot, this wine opens with aromas of sweet barrel spices followed by dried red and black fruit. The palate is fruit-forward and flavorful, bringing you back for another sip.",89
Kerin O’Keefe,Pala 2013 Assoluto White (Isola dei Nuraghi),"Made with 80% Nasco and 20% Vermentino, this offers delicate aromas of marzipan, dried apricot and wildflower honey. On the sweet, full-bodied palate, notes of white almond back up acacia honey and tangerine zest.",89
Sean P. Sullivan,14 Hands 2013 Reserve M-S-G-V Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"Mourvèdre and Syrah each make up a third of this wine with the rest Grenache and Viognier. The latter (12%) shows itself prominently on the aromas, with perfumed notes of purple flowers and orange peel that are followed by purple fruit, vanilla, coffee and spice. The palate offers elegant, yet sweet and flavorful pomegranate and cranberry flavors with pleasing spice accents.",89
Sean P. Sullivan,Amavi 2014 Semillon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Honeycomb, fig and herb aromas are followed by textured flavors that show intensity and persistence.",89
Kerin O’Keefe,Basilisco 2011 Teodosio  (Aglianico del Vulture),"This fragrant red opens with lovely scents of perfumed berry, blue flower and Oriental spice while the polished palate offers dried black cherry, blackberry, anise and clove. Fine-grained tannins give the finish grip.",89
Sean P. Sullivan,Bontzu 2013 Malbec (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Vanilla, thyme, dill and plum aromas are followed by plentiful fruit and barrel flavors that possess a pleasing mouthfeel. The oak is out front at times, especially on the aromas, but the wine is appealing.",89
Matt Kettmann,Burrell School Vineyards 2011 Honor Roll Estate Reserve Merlot (Santa Cruz Mountains),"A mountaintop vineyard in a cool year delivers the expected lighter elegance, offering a complicated and fascinating array of aromas, from incense and white pepper to patchouli and potpourri. The palate starts with sour cherries before the herbal lift of fennel and dill arrives, proving a light, curious and tasty wine.",89
Sean P. Sullivan,Stottle 2012 Big Eddie Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Merlot (55%) and Cabernet Sauvignon (40%) make up the majority of this wine with the balance Malbec. Vanilla, barrel spice and dark-fruit aromas are followed by saturated black-fruit flavors that linger. The oak gets a bit out-front but the wine still has much to offer.",89
Sean P. Sullivan,Stottle 2012 Elerding 6 Prong Malbec (Horse Heaven Hills),"Blue-fruit aromas intermingle with vanilla and other barrel spices. The coffee and plum flavors are full and supple in feel, followed by a tart finish. The wood seems a bit primary but the fruit and feel is still hard to ignore.",89
Sean P. Sullivan,àMaurice 2013 Fred Estate Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Bright aromas of freshly roasted coffee beans, brown stems, dried herbs, purple flowers, mineral and black pepper are followed by ethereally light fruit and savory flavors that focus on elegance. This wine provides plenty of interest but the finish seems a bit clipped. It might lengthen out with aging.",89
Sean P. Sullivan,àMaurice 2014 Boushey Vineyard Syrah (Yakima Valley),"Coming from one of the state's premier Syrah vineyards, this warm-vintage wine seems aromatically quiet, with light aromas of funk, earth, red berries and coffee. Flavors are generous and ripe, with the alcohol occasionally poking out.",89
Sean P. Sullivan,àMaurice 2014 Boushey Vineyard Marsanne-Viognier (Yakima Valley),"The aromas of flowers, mineral, peach and almond are initially light but pleasing. The stone-fruit flavors are full bodied and sweet, pulling up ever so slightly on the finish.",89
Sean P. Sullivan,Amavi 2013 Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Les Collines and Stone Valley fruit make up 75% of this wine with the rest coming from Seven Hills, Pepper Bridge and Summit View. It offers generous aromas of blueberry puree, dried herbs, red fruit, woodspice, dried flowers and mineral. The flavors bring the same but are more pulled-back than the aromas suggest, with a bit of astringency that holds the wine back.",89
Sean P. Sullivan,Brian Carter Cellars NV One Upland Vineyard Touriga Nacional (Snipes Mountain),"Examples of this variety are rare in the state. Aromas pop with heaping amounts of fresh flowers and orange peel that are reminiscent of freesia in their intensity. The coffee and blue-fruit flavors are smooth and sultry, showing pleasing depth.",89
Virginie Boone,Charthia 2013 Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Specks of rosemary give the aromatic entry of this wine a nice herbal invitation. This subtlety is followed by more bombastic waves of big, juicy black cherry, berry and oak. The tannins are still substantial, suggesting cellaring, through 2021.",89
Roger Voss,Château de Chantegrive 2013  Graves,"The gravel soil on this Lévèque family property makes a great place to grow white grapes. A 50/50 blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon, this fresh wine suggests the ability to age. It is fruity now, hinting at apricots as well as citrus. It can be drunk now for its freshness, although wait until late 2016 for it to develop greater depths.",89
Roger Voss,Château Mayne Vieil 2011 Cuvée Aliénor  (Fronsac),"Spice and ripe fruit, with attractive tannins and a soft texture. This wine is open, generous, rich and packed with black currant fruitiness. Give this wine another 2–4 years, but it could well be drinkable sooner.",90
Roger Voss,F X Pichler 2012 Loibner Klostersatz Federspiel Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),"This is a crisp, but also rich style of Federspiel. It is full of ripe pear and apple flavor as well as a fine pinch of pepper. Acidity creeps in the background to balance this ready-to-drink wine. Screwcap.",90
Joe Czerwinski,Frankland Estate 2012 Poison Hill Vineyard Riesling (Frankland River),"The most aromatically complex of the FE 2012 Rieslings, the Poison Hill offers beguiling scents of tangerine sherbet and Earl Grey tea. It's almost too perfumy for its soft, medium-bodied structure and slightly dusty-textured finish, but those floral elements are also its appeal. Drink now–2020+.",90
Roger Voss,Graf Hardegg 2010 Steinbügel Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),"This is a serious wine, despite the ripe fruitiness on its surface. It is full of peach and mango flavors, but structured by a cool, mineral feel. Tangy acidity and tight texture adds tension. It still needs to age 2–4 years. Screwcap.",90
Anna Lee C. Iijima,A. Christmann 2010 Gimmeldinger Biengarten Trocken Riesling (Pfalz),"Exquisitely smoky and savory dried herb tones calibrate rich, tropical fruit aromas on this dry yet voluptuously textured Riesling. The palate is penetrating with minerality and a soft, elegant lemon-lime acidity. Finishes long and rich.",90
Paul Gregutt,àMaurice 2010 Gamache Vineyard Malbec (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Single vineyard, 100% varietal Malbec can be spot on, and this succeeds with a balanced flavor profile of mixed berries and earthy tannins. There's a hint of volatility, that quickly blows off. Decanting for an hour or so is advised.",90
Kerin O’Keefe,Barale Fratelli 2009 Bussia  (Barolo),"This traditionally styled Barolo has a classic fragrance of violet, rose and leather, with balsamic notes. The palate reveals ripe berry and spice with notes of pipe tobacco and while the acidity is tame the wine is massively tannic. Hold this for a few more years, but drink it before 2020.",90
Kerin O’Keefe,Barale Fratelli 2009 Castellero  (Barolo),"This shows enticing aromas of mint, spice and balsamic herbs and delivers a restrained palate of black cherry, with undertones of sage, white pepper, coffee and espresso. This is still aggressively tannic and needs time to soften.",90
Paul Gregutt,Gamache 2009 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Rich cherry fruit anchors this excellent, estate-grown Merlot. It's lush and textural, with deep, dark fruit flavors and pleasant roasted notes of coffee and smoke. Half the barrels were new American oak, the rest French, mostly new.",90
Joe Czerwinski,Hope Estate 2010 The Ripper Shiraz (Geographe),"Made in a superripe, dense, almost fudge-like style, The Ripper tastes like a plummy, chocolaty Christmas cake with slightly coarse tannins on the finish. It's Port-like in flavor, but without the heat from elevated alcohol. Drink it over the next few years.",90
Roger Voss,Hirsch 2012 Zöbing Riesling (Kamptal),"Crisp, clean, mineral wine, with hints of a more aromatic character in the background, this is packed with apple and lemon flavors. A straight line of delicious acidity cuts like a knife through the wine. For aging over 3–5 years. Screwcap.",90
Lauren Buzzeo,Pelter 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz (Galilee),"This is a balanced and complex fifty-fifty blend, with herbal accents of licorice root, coffee bean and foliage that mingle harmoniously with ripe fruit notes of blackberry, wild raspberry and cherry. Medium weight and lushly textured, but not overdone, with a long finish that delivers light hints of mocha and pepper.",90
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Peter Nicolay 2011 Bernkasteler Badstube Spätlese Riesling (Mosel),"Wet stone and earth notes add a distinct minerality to intensely fruity peach and apricot flavors on this ripe, but dainty Riesling. Zippy acidity and a flurry of fresh, green herbs make for a brisk finish.",90
Joe Czerwinski,Plantagenet 2010 Omrah Shiraz (Western Australia),"An easy-drinking introduction to Shiraz from Western Australia's Great Southern region, the 2010 Omrah offers gentle cherry and cedar notes accented by hints of chocolate and roasted meat. It's medium to full bodied, with a round, supple mouthfeel that ends in a wash of softly dusty tannins.",90
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Rheingraf 2011 Trocken Riesling (Rheinhessen),"Whiffs of slate and petrol add nuance to white flower and pineapple aromas on this intensely minerally, dry Riesling. The palate is lush and full with ripe nectarine flavor, freshened with a swathe of fresh green herbs on the finish.",90
Joe Czerwinski,Robert Oatley 2009 Finisterre Cabernet Sauvignon (Margaret River),"There's a lot to like in this effort: ample dark fruit, complex notions of tea leaves and dried grasses, and a richly textured, long finish. The wine is medium bodied and not very tannic, making it easy to sip repeatedly. Drink it over the next 8–10 years.",90
,Iron Horse 2011 Unoaked Chardonnay (Green Valley),"Ripe, flashy fruit stars in this unoaked Chardonnay, in the form of pineapples, kiwis, limes and pears. The grapes for this delicious wine come from the winery's estate vineyard, in the cool southwestern pocket of the Russian River Valley.",90
Virginie Boone,La Clarine Farm 2012 Rosé (Sierra Foothills),"La Clarine Farm's rosé is slightly cloudy, sourced mostly from Syrah grapes, with unusual additions of Mourvèdre, Sémillon and Viognier. Winemaker Hank Beckmeyer says the Syrah grapes barely ripen and that's why he likes them for this wine. Light at 12.8% alcohol, it's an intriguing melange of earthy dark strawberry and mint, crisp in acidity.",90
Michael Schachner,La Playa 2010 Axel Primero Red (Colchagua Valley),"Oak, resin, vanilla and creamy aromas run side by side with cherry, cassis and berry scents on this blend of Cabernet, Carmenère, Petit Verdot and Syrah. The palate is tight, juicy and textured, with good density. Flavors of creamy oak, mocha, raspberry and plum set up a medium-length, strong finish. Drink through 2017.",90
,Maldonado 2011 Los Olivos Pinot Noir (Napa Valley),"This is a rich, robust Pinot Noir, defining the big, tannic style. It explodes in cherry, cola and pomegranate fruit flavors, with the added note of caramelized oak. You can drink this wine now, but it should hold in the bottle for 6–8 years, gradually mellowing. The vineyard is in the cooler southern part of the valley, near Carneros.",90
,Medlock Ames 2008 Bell Mountain Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),This Cab wants a few more years to let its internal inconsistencies resolve. The primary cherry and blackberry fruit has faded and is turning nutty. But it's still pretty tannic. Needs to throw some sediment to let the inherent fruit emerge. Try after 2016.,90
Michael Schachner,Morandé 2009 Edición Limitada Carmenère (Maipo Valley),"Earthy aromas include pencil eraser, wild herbs and eucalyptus along with tea and blackberry. This is very smooth and lush in the mouth, a reflection of a warm vintage. Flavors of olive, herbs, tobacco and black fruits are textbook for the variety, while a mellow, polished finish is silky and easygoing. Drink through 2016.",90
Michael Schachner,Ochagavia 2010 Raices Nobles Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),"This wine from the Santa Carolina family opens with ripe blackberry, prune and minerally aromas. It's rubbery and deep on the palate, with dark, toasty flavors of blackberry and bitter chocolate. A lightly herbal and spicy tasting finish with medium intensity fades away with lactic creaminess.",90
Paul Gregutt,Barnard Griffin 2011 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Though labeled simply Columbia Valley, this is a classic example of Wahluke Slope Syrah. Well-integrated layers of citrus, berry, roasted coffee beans, vanilla cookie and Graham cracker combine into a most accessible, yet complex wine. It's ready to drink, and should be consumed over the next 3–4 years.",90
Paul Gregutt,Barrister 2009 Bacchus Vineyard Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Thick, heavy, potent and mouth-coating, this is a liquorous, almost syrupy wine, sure to please those who like big fruit, big tannins, and big barrel flavors. Chocolate, espresso, tar and bourbon barrel flavors dominate, in keeping with the house style.",90
,Bougetz 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Lots of muscle in this punchy Sauvignon Blanc, with its ripe lemon, lime, orange and papaya flavors, made bright by crisp acidity. Despite a streak of honey, the finish is dry. Additional richness is provided by barrel fermentation and the addition of a little Sémillon.",90
Joe Czerwinski,West Cape Howe 2009 Book Ends Cabernet Sauvignon (Western Australia),"This is a solid value in the world of Cabernet. Textbook notes of cassis and mint lead the way, framed by supple tannins and dressed up with hints of graham crackers and black tea. This is medium to full in weight, with a mouthwatering, velvety finish that belies its price point. Drink now–2020+.",90
Paul Gregutt,William Church 2010 2 Spires Syrah-Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is a blend of 67% Syrah and 33% Cabernet Sauvignon from Red Willow and Dineen, respectively. Though it falls on the lighter side for Washington Syrah, it's proportionate and pleasing, with strawberry fruit, mocha and toast. Tannins are fine and slender; though drinking well now, this could be cellared for awhile longer.",90
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Karl Kaspar 2010 Kabinett Riesling (Mosel),"Tantalizing spice notes mix with aromas of quince and lanolin on this fabulous bargain Riesling. While intensely tropical on the palate, it's remarkably nuanced with hints of potpourri, white flowers, and a sharp, steely acidity. Perfect as an aperitif, or paired with spicy, herbaceous Asian cuisine.",90
Paul Gregutt,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"With 12% Sémillon in the blend, this is a lovely, fresh, almost exuberant Sauvignon Blanc. Bracing and textural, with good varietal character but no excessive herbaceousness, it's loaded with fruit flavors of melon, grapefruit, kiwi and apple. A fine mix of precision and length.",90
Michael Schachner,Michel Torino 2006 Coleccion Chardonnay (Calchaquí Valley),"Aromas of sweet melon and honey suggest an innocuous quality that's confirmed on the palate, where basic apple and pear flavors come across a bit sweet. Finishes with some scour and a little harshness.",83
Susan Kostrzewa,Pillitteri 2004 Fusion Gewürztraminer-Riesling (Niagara Peninsula),"A slightly earthy, spicy nose leads, followed up by good acidity and a touch of flowers. Pair with a cheese plate or enjoy on its own. Imported by Wine Emporium.",83
Joe Czerwinski,Black Swan 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (South Eastern Australia),"Smooth and medium-bodied, with modest cherry scents and cassis and tobacco flavors. Soft and lacking energy on the finish, but clean.",83
Michael Schachner,Funky Llama 2007 Tempranillo (Mendoza),"Lightly brambled and ever so slightly green, with pleasant strawberry and raspberry aromas. The mouthfeel is a touch choppy and grabby, but it's not too thin and rough to make it unpleasant. Not bad for the price.",83
,Borgo di Colloredo 2005 Gironia Biferno Rosato Red (Molise),"The wine's garnet ruby color is so saturated, it seems more like a light red than a rosato and the aromas recall raspberry, white almond, peppermint and a hint of Sherry.",83
Susan Kostrzewa,Alba 2005 Dry Riesling (New Jersey),"Creamy and fresh on the nose and followed by a play of good acidity and body, this Riesling from New Jersey is both supple and refreshing. The flavors fall a bit flat though—and need more dimension.",83
,Congress Springs 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"Harsh and hot, with chili pepper, mint and thinned-down blackberry and cherry flavors.",82
,Congress Springs 2006 Viognier (Lodi),"You'll find sweet and sour flavors in this wine, like in a LifeSaver lemon candy. The best part is the acidity, which is tart, and keeps the wine balanced.",82
,Jenica Peak 2006 Coastal Series Pinot Grigio (California),"Soft and sweet, with canned apricot and syrupy peach flavors.",82
,Norman 2006 Reserve Chardonnay (Edna Valley),"Sharp and green, with a minty, chlorophyll taste. High acidity makes the finish searing.",82
,Pride Mountain 2005 Sangiovese (Sonoma County),"Pride continues to struggle with this variety, as does everyone else in California who tries their hand at it. The '05 is semisweet and simple, with candied cherry-blackberry flavors that finish more like a dessert wine than a dry table wine.",82
,Mazzocco 2005 Stone Zinfandel (Alexander Valley),"With 15.5% alcohol, this wine is too hot for balance. It also tastes unnecessarily sweet, with sugared raspberry, cherry and blackberry flavors.",82
,Congress Springs 2006 Chardonnay (California),"The structure on this wine is just fine, with crisp, coastal acidity and low alcohol making for a clean, well-balanced Chard. Its weakness is in the thinness of flavor. The wine is watery, with mere traces of citrus fruits and peaches.",82
Paul Gregutt,Emerson 2006 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"This is Pinot Gris without any particular varietal character; it could be almost anything. It's got tart, lemon-flavored fruit and a thin, watery finish.",82
,Four Vines 2005 Maverick Zinfandel (Amador County),"Barbecue is your best bet with this rustic Zin. It's lusty in jammy blackberry, mulberry and vanilla spice flavors that finish with a definite sugariness.",82
,Four Vines 2005 Old Vine Cuvée Zinfandel (California),"Except for the sweetness, this is a pretty good wine. It has rich tannins, decent acidity, and ripe flavors of blackberry, cherry and raspberry jam. But that white sugary taste is off-putting in a table wine.",82
Joe Czerwinski,Hesketh 2008 Usual Suspects Shiraz (McLaren Vale),"A drink-now style of warming Shiraz, with plenty of weight and richness, soft tannins and flavors that artfully combine sour plum, cracked pepper, rare beef and chocolate. Drink it over the next few years.",90
,Avignonesi 2007 Desiderio Merlot (Cortona),"Desiderio, a legendary Italian Merlot, shows slightly sour aromas this vintage with cherry, pressed flowers, natural rubber and spice. It's a hearty, well-concentrated wine with loads of density and intense cherry fruit on the close.",90
Roger Voss,Borges 2009 Touriga Nacional (Dão),"Although known in the Douro as an increasingly essential component of Port and table wines, the Touriga Nacional is equally at home in the Dão. As here, it produces linear wines, very mineral, full of acidity with a perfumed elegance. This is a wine for aging over 4–5 years.",90
,Caccia al Piano 1868 2009 Ruit Hora  (Bolgheri),"Merlot (70%), Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot make for a smooth and rich wine with candied fruit, blueberry, spice and loads of sweet cherry. It's chewy and tight in the mouth, with polished, almost squeaky tannins and impressive length.",90
Roger Voss,Château Haut-Peyrous 2009  Graves,"Ripe, full-bodied white Graves, its flavors coming from tropical fruit, rich and complex. Good wood underscores the yellow fruit flavors and ripeness. Ready to drink, but could also age 2–3 years.",90
Roger Voss,Château Lafleur-Gazin 2009  Pomerol,"Darkly tannic wine, packed with dryness. The result is firm at this stage, always likely to be full of tannins, but there is delicious fruit under this dryness.",90
Roger Voss,Château Lieujean 2009  Haut-Médoc,"Dominated by Cabernet Sauvignon, the wine is packed with dusty tannins. Mint flavors show the wood aging while black currant boosts the fruit side of the wine. It is rich, its fruit very ripe yet also elegant.",90
Roger Voss,Château Liversan 2009  Haut-Médoc,"A wine that shows rich blackberry fruits, already rounded and soft. It has a tannic structure that is embedded in the fruit, along with spice, toast and a firm finish. An ageworthy wine.",90
,J. Rickards 2009 Brown Barn Vineyard Petite Sirah (Alexander Valley),"A solid Petite Sirah. You can use it in a wine education class as a textbook example of the variety. It's full bodied, tannic and rich in blackberry, blueberry, crème de cassis, cola, grilled meat and black pepper flavors, enhanced by oak. Should age effortlessly, without gaining complexity, for many years.",90
Joe Czerwinski,Jansz NV Premium Brut Rosé Sparkling (Tasmania),"This pale salmon rosé is a reliable sparkling wine at a very good price. The latest NV release is toasty on the nose, then offers just faint hints of peach or berry flavors. It's lithe yet creamy on the palate, with a long finish.",90
Michael Schachner,Antiyal 2009 Kuyen Red (Maipo Valley),"Fresh berry, mint, cola and herb aromas make for a classic Maipo bouquet. Feels fresh and good, with plying tannins and bright acidity. Tastes earthy, mossy and herbal, with ample berry fruit. Licorice and prune flavors carry the finish. Syrah with Cabernet, Carmenère and Petit Verdot.",90
Joe Czerwinski,Jacob's Creek 2009 Reserve Chardonnay (Adelaide Hills),"Each Jacob's Creek Reserve wine is now sourced from a specific region, and this Chardonnay shows solid improvement as a result. It's medium in body, with notes of grilled pineapple and sweet corn and a brisk, citrusy finish. Drink it over the next 6–9 months.",89
,Le Buche 2008 Olivi Cantine Pugnitello (Toscana),"You won't find many wines made with the Pugnitello grape (a native variety of Tuscany) and that's what is special about this bottle. The wine shows ripe fruit, blackberry and a soft, velvety texture.",89
Virginie Boone,Leonesse Cellars 2008 Vista Del Monte Vineyard Syrah (Temecula Valley),"All black cherry and blueberry jam, this South Coast Syrah is fruity and spicy, full and fleshy with pepper and cinnamon spice and a teaspoon of black tea playfully showing through. Consistent throughout, a wine that's easy to like and complex at the same time. It spent close to two years in French oak, 30% of it new.",89
,Liberty School 2010 Chardonnay (Central Coast),"A really good value in a California Chardonnay. Blended with a touch of Viognier to add brightness, and fermented in a little new oak, it hits just the right notes for today's popular taste. Slightly sweet in buttered toast and pineapple jam flavors, it's balanced with crisp acidity and a stony minerality.",89
,Marchesi Antinori 2009 Guado al Tasso il Bruciato  (Bolgheri),"Il Bruciato (an expression of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah and other varieties) shows pulpy fruit tones with ripe aromas of cherry, raspberry. leather and tobacco. The wine is smooth and soft with a spicy, fruity texture.",89
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Millbrook 2010 25th Anniversary Pinot Noir (Hudson River Region),"Rose petal, mocha and a deeply concentrated red fruit palate make this a bold, beautifully constructed Pinot. Full bodied but nuanced with layers of dried herbs and florals, it finishes long with a soft layer of feathery tannins.",89
Paul Gregutt,Nefarious 2009 Cabernet Franc (Wahluke Slope),"As before, this is Weinbau vineyard fruit. The 2009 vintage seems to have presented some challenges, as the fruit flavors suggest uneven ripening, with a mix of tutti-fruity candy flavors along with some raisins. Tannins are smooth and there's a pleasing streak of graphite running through the finish. Drink soon.",89
Paul Gregutt,O•S Winery 2009 The Tusk Elephant Mountain Vineyard Merlot (Yakima Valley),"Broadly fruity, this dark and smooth Merlot is loaded with a luscious mix of black fruits. The flavors play out in forward, accessible fashion, flecked with a pleasing minerality.",89
Paul Gregutt,Owen Roe 2009 Ex Umbris Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Spicy and bright, with an almost-too-ripe note to the fruit. Sweet ripe berries are joined by hints of sweet tomato and fecund, autumnal flavors, suggesting that this Syrah should be consumed sooner rather than later.",89
Roger Voss,Quinta de Foz de Arouce 2009 Branco Cerceal (Beiras),"A wild, herbal, wood-aged wine, its acidity a fine foil to the richly perfumed fruit. Pears and sweet melon come together with the toast of the wood. At this stage, the wood dominates and needs a year to soften—then the result will be impressively food-friendly.",89
Roger Voss,Quinta do Cavalinho 2009 Templários Colheita Seleccionada Red (Tejo),"The aroma shines with Syrah perfumes, while the palate brings together great ripe perfumed and spiced fruit, smooth, rich and dense. There is just an earthy element that needs to soften over the next two years.",89
Roger Voss,Rozes 2008 Quinta do Grifo Grande Reserva Red (Douro),"A wine that starts out all tannins. The fruit takes a while to show through and then produces juicy red cherry flavors and considerable acidity, the wood aging rounding the corners. This is for medium-term aging.",89
,Casa di Terra 2010 Moreccio  (Bolgheri),"Despite its youth, Moreccio (a blend of Syrah, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon) really delivers the goods. Plush, soft and rich, it offers ripe concentration and mature aromas of spice, sweet cherry and blackberry. It's smooth, beautifully soft and caresses the palate.",89
Roger Voss,Château d'Angludet 2009  Margaux,"The wine has weight, is warm and spicy, with bold fruit flavors. A fine wine from Angludet, it is ripe, the wood judiciously balanced, finishing with tight acidity.",89
Roger Voss,Château Laforge 2009  Saint-Émilion,"Dominated by Merlot, this is a fruity and rich wine, rounded, ripe and spicy. It has density and weight, layered with dusty rich tannins. With its spice, blackberry acidity and chunky feel, it is already drinkable, but will age over several years.",89
Roger Voss,Château Soutard 2009  Saint-Émilion,"A wine from a château that is still finding its form . It is soft, open, with attractive juicy red fruits and black currants, ready to drink soon.",89
Roger Voss,Château Tour de Lagarde 2009  Saint-Émilion,"Big, dense wine, with dusty tannins and ripe red plum fruits. The wine is concentrated, fruity while also structured. It is already balanced, the acidity giving freshness, the texture showing the delicious ripe character of the vintage.",89
,Conte Ferdinando Guicciardini 2008 Massi di Mandorlaia Riserva  (Morellino di Scansano),"Sweet, thick and plump, this Morellino Riserva shines. It shows thick layers of cherry, blackberry, leather and spice. Pair it with pasta shells stuffed with ricotta and spinach.",89
,Donna Olimpia 1898 2009 Tageto Red (Toscana),"Tageto shows a compact, elegant style with ripe cherry, cassis, rum cake and leather aromas. Sweet fruit and lively spice appear on the close.",89
Kerin O’Keefe,Zymè 2006  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,"The nose of this wine leads with forward oak and vanilla aromas. The palate offers more personality and ripe, luscious fruit flavors, with additional notes of spice and toast. While it shows some complexity, it's fast approaching its optimum drinking window, so enjoy soon.",90
,Howell Mountain Vineyards 2010 Old Vine Zinfandel (Howell Mountain),"As big as you expect a Howell Mountain Zin to be, offering rich, deep blackberry, currant, chocolate, licorice, bacon and cedar flavors that are sweet and dry at the same time. It's not just powerful in flavor, it's wonderful in structure, with refined tannins and balancing acidity. A minor criticism is some heat from alcohol, but that's the nature of ripe Zinfandel.",90
Paul Gregutt,J. Bookwalter 2010 Conner Lee Vineyard Conflict Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Conflict is two thirds Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot, and 8% Cabernet Franc. Smoke wreathes around deep cherry candy flavors, leading into some chewy tannins dusted with savory herbs.",90
Paul Gregutt,Januik 2011 Cold Creek Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This lush Chardonnay has a certain oiliness to the aromas, along with dusty, toasty components that ride through a soft, plush mid-palate. The fruit is a rich mix of peach and apricot, highlighted with toasted hazelnuts, vanilla and coconut.",90
Roger Voss,Umathum 2011 Beerenauslese White (Burgenland),"Dry spice is fighting with rich, smooth Chardonnay to give a wine that is unbalanced at the moment. It is full, fragrant, still young so the dried almond edge should melt into the more honeyed character. Drink from 2017.",90
Kerin O’Keefe,Venturini Massimino 2009 Semonte Alto  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso),"This is rich in black cherry flavors, with layered accents of white pepper, almond and walnut. It's the perfect marriage between the elegance of Valpolicella and the structure of Amarone. Imported by Panebianco, Vinity Wine Company.",90
,Chandon 2008 Vintage Brut Sparkling (Yountville),"This sparkling wine is one of the best from Chandon in years. There's a soft refinement to the mousse, making it just as good as its more expensive rivals. Shows complex flavors of yeast, limes, oranges, vanilla and honey.",90
,Frazier 2009 Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley),"This Cab Franc is rich and ripe in red and black currants and cherries, with a mocha sweet earthiness leading to sweet oak buttered cinnamon toast and a slight caramelization. It's dry and smooth in tannins. Best of all is an acidity and minerality that lend structure. Drink now–2015.",90
Lauren Buzzeo,Domaine Cabirau 2011 Serge & Nicolas Red (Maury Sec),"Ripe, jammy black-fruit sensations dominate the nose and mouth of this wine, with lush, expressive notes of blackberry, black raspberry and boysenberry preserves. The texture is like crushed satin, with medium-plus yet fine tannins and a cocoa-kissed finish. Enjoyable now, but should develop additional complexities after 2016.",90
,Frias 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District),"Give this Cabernet high marks for sheer lusciousness. It's ripe in blackberries, black cherries and currants, with a veneer of sweet oak. Not a longterm ager, so drink over the next five years.",90
Roger Voss,Georges Duboeuf 2011 Domaine des Pontheux  (Chiroubles),"This is a concentrated, firm and tannic wine. It has a structured feel from Chiroubles, which are the highest vineyards in Beaujolais. With its black fruits, dark tannins and concentrated texture, it could certainly age for 2–3 years, although it is ready to drink now.",90
,Orentano 2009 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Showing some mature notes at the age of four years or so, with a mellow texture framing cherry pie, cola and spice flavors. Feels silky, lush and delightful. Drink now–2015 as the fruit gradually fades away.",90
Michael Schachner,Riglos 2010 Gran Las Divas Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Tupungato),"Blackberry and cassis aromas blend seamlessly with varietal scents of herbs and leaves. This Cab Franc feels crisp yet flush, with laudable structure and vital acidity. Flavors of leafy, spicy berry and plum finish with peppery notes, a jolt of salinity and heft.",90
Lauren Buzzeo,Les Villages de Terroir Catalan 2010 Red (Côtes du Roussillon Villages Caramany),"This is vibrant and expressive, with upfront purple-flower fragrances of violet and iris mixed with fruity tones of boysenberry and raspberry sauce. The crushed-silk texture offers medium tannins, ample acidity and skin-driven fruit flavors. Roasted coffee bean and sweet smoke accents mark the lingering finish.",90
Paul Gregutt,J. Bookwalter 2010 Foreshadow Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is 89% Cabernet Sauvignon, 8% Merlot and 3% Syrah. It's toasty to the max, with scents and flavors of coffee and smoke as much as berry and cassis. There is great acid/tannin balance and some additional years of bottle age should help to bring out more of the fruit.",90
,Keller Estate 2010 La Cruz Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Leaner and tighter than this bottling has been the previous few vintages, this wine is showing hard tannins obscure in plum, black cherry pie and mocha flavors. Yet it's a balanced wine, which should develop bottle complexity after 2016.",90
Paul Gregutt,L'Ecole No. 41 2012 Sémillon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"L'Ecole tackles, with great success, two of the least-recognized strengths of Washington viticulture: Sémillon and Chenin Blanc. Here the blend includes 13% Sauvignon Blanc. It's well built, full bodied, with a mix of citrus and stone fruits, generous acidity, and some finishing skin flavors putting a slightly bitter frame around it.",90
Paul Gregutt,L'Ecole No. 41 2012 Seven Hills Vineyard Estate Luminesce Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This wine is mostly Sémillon, with Sauvignon Blanc filling in the rest. It's one of the rare white wines from the Walla Walla AVA, graceful, full-bodied and tasting of fig and green banana. Just recently bottled, it still carries a bit of yeast in the nose and in the finish. Give it another few months to pull itself together.",90
Roger Voss,Lionel Osmin & Cie 2011 Donibane Red (Irrouléguy),"Coming from the Basque country, this blend of Cabernet Franc and Tannat is both perfumed and firmly structured. It is a solid wine, showing its wood aging while bringing out great ripe berry fruits. Drink from 2014.",90
,Melville 2012 Clone 76 Inox Estate Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),"Inox is the winery's unoaked Chardonnay, the first of the vintage. This bottling provides a promising glimpse into the quality of the 2012s. It's so rich and ripe in citrus and tropical fruits, you won't miss the barrel influence. Try now with sushi, tuna tartare, or a salad of bitter greens, tropical fruits and feta cheese.",90
Virginie Boone,Bravium 2011 Signal Ridge Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mendocino Ridge),"A larger selection from Signal Ridge, Bravium's main bottling is still tiny production, light on its feet and aromatic in rose petal and violet. With notes of black cherry and pomegranate its tannins are silky and the wine deliciously priced.",90
Roger Voss,Antonin Rodet 2010  Givry,"Givry is one of the unsung values in Burgundy. This ripe and structured wine shows why. It has weight, a firm texture and red plum and strawberry fruit flavors. All these elements are held together by a dark sense of tannin and fine acidity.",90
Michael Schachner,Bodegas Muriel 2004 Viña Muriel Gran Reserva  (Rioja),"Earthy, mildly leafy aromas of dried red fruits and vanilla are textbook for Rioja gran reserva. A medium-bodied palate shows balsamic richness along with flavors of prune, raisin, cassis and loamy earth. This is mild but solid on the finish, with a quick fade to the fruit component. Drink now.",90
Kerin O’Keefe,Zenato 2007 Sergio Zenato Riserva  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),"This muscular Amarone has an almost overripe fragrance, along with chocolate and vanilla notes. The alcohol is forward on the palate, but it also delivers sweet plum, prune and black pepper flavor, with hints of vanilla and coffee. This is direct and powerfully structured.",90
Roger Voss,Heidi Schröck 2010 Ruster Ausbruch White (Burgenland),"his blend has a spicy character, balanced with acidity and a ripe, full honeyed character. On the dry side, it has richness, pepper and a deep texture that demands aging. Drink from 2017.",90
Sean P. Sullivan,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2010 Canoe Ridge Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills),"This 95% Cabernet Sauvignon with the balance of Merlot, Syrah and Malbec, is immediately accessible with notes of char, roasted coffee bean and cherry. The palate is rich, chocolaty and seamlessly stitched together.",90
Roger Voss,Damien et Romain Bouchard 2011 Montée de Tonnerre Premier Cru  (Chablis),"A complex wine, full of tight textures, apple skins and mineral acidity. This is a wine for aging, its wood character beautifully judged, rounding out the crisp final texture. Drink from 2016.",90
,Eponymous 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District),"Rich in black cherry jam, mocha and toasty oak flavors, this wine offers the firm tannins and minerality that give a young Spring Mountain Cabernet its noticeable characteristics. Give it eight years to begin to come around.",90
,Gloria Ferrer 2005 Royal Cuvée Sparkling (Carneros),"This brut-style bubbly is comprised of 67% Pinot Noir and 33% Chardonnay and shows aspects of both varieties. It's fairly full bodied, with raspberry, strawberry, lime, brioche, vanilla and toast flavors. Feels elegant, complex and lush in the mouth, and should develop additional bottle notes over the next six years.",90
,Hall 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),"This is a good example of the high-alcohol style of warmth and deliciousness. While it's not common for Stags Leap wines to have these characteristics, it is incredibly deep in black cherries, milk chocolate and oak, with a spicy finish that goes on for a long time, indicating the power of this Cabernet. Drink over the next six years.",90
Joe Czerwinski,Geretto 2001 Pinot Grigio (Delle Venezie),"Unexpectedly thick and mouthfilling, with generous peach aromas and flavors underscored by mustard greens and citrus. Clean and refreshing on the finish. Best Buy.",87
,L.A. Cetto 1996 Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Valle de Guadalupe),"Aromas of mature Cabernet: cassis, tobacco leaf and a touch of caramel. Not overly rich or heavy, this is a pretty, lightweight Cab best enjoyed now.",87
Michael Schachner,La Playa 2002 Estate Reserve Chardonnay (Colchagua Valley),"Fresh and clean, with light, lemony aromas in addition to tropical fruit. The palate is textured and full, with fairly pure apple and pineapple flavors and some nuttiness. Everything works here, including the smooth, lengthy finish.  Best Buy.",87
Michael Schachner,Undurraga 2001 Reserva Merlot (Maipo Valley),"Smooth smelling, with pure and fresh berry and plum aromas. Very young and a bit tangy on the palate, with cherry and berry flavors and an oaky, soft finish that goes sweet then sour, and lasts for a long time. In terms of structure, it's balanced, mildly tannic, yet meant for drinking now.",87
,Lane Tanner 2000 Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"The “least” of Lane Tanner's range of Pinots, but complex and delicious. Ripe berry and spice flavors are rich, and there's a tangy earthiness suggesting sauteed mushrooms. Very dry and crisp, with a silky texture and a long, smooth finish.",87
,Lolonis 2001 Fumé Blanc (Redwood Valley),"From an emerging Mendocino appellation, an engaging, dry wine. Its mouth-cleansing acidity is fresh and clean, highlighting pretty flavors of lime and honeydew, and leads to a tart finish.",87
,River Road 2001 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Simple, delicate and fruity, a jammy style with sweetly ripe flavors of wild raspberries and strawberries, as well as espresso, tobacco and Oriental spices. It's light and silky on the palate.",87
Michael Schachner,Santa Ines 2001 Legado de Armida Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Maipo Valley),"Creamy aromas of vanilla and pears also carry some typical Sauvignon Blanc pungency. For a rounder style, which it is, it's quite refreshing. The mix across the palate of banana, grapefruit and almonds is attractive, and so is the round, pretty finish. Drink it very soon.",87
,Sebastiani 1996 Cherryblock Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),"Lean and angular right now, showing hints of mint and chocolate—the oak sticks out a bit over the tart cherry flavors.",87
,Signorello 2001 Seta Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"A good wine, grape-wise, with sharply etched, pure fruity flavors of citrus, fig and sweet tobacco. Acidity is fresh and juicy, and the wine is fully dry. Barrel fermented, it is super-oaky, maybe too much so, from the charry aromas to the woody flavors.",87
,Silver 2000 Julia's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),"This is a full-bodied Pinot, packed with ripe cherry and strawberry flavors and framed in spicy nuance. A shade hot on the finish, ending with an unusually bright licorice and herbal edge.",87
Joe Czerwinski,Bortoluzzi 2001 Pinot Grigio (Isonzo del Friuli),"An open-knit, friendly nose features lots of nectarine and ripe apple scents. Medium-weight, with plenty of stone fruit on the palate, it finishes with a cleansing burst of peppery spice. Try as an apéritif.",87
,Château La Joya 2000 Estate Bottled Reserve Merlot (Colchagua Valley),"This is a great house pour for fans of Chilean Merlot with its consistent fruit, soft acidity and low tannins. On the nose and palate, a core of sweet, Red Delicious apple is accented by dry leather, toasty vanilla and dried herbs. Simple, but well crafted.",87
Michael Schachner,Two Brothers 2001 Big Tattoo Red Red (Colchagua Valley),"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot starts off a bit murky and brooding but then displays raspberry and plum fruit, and some big-time heft. A tad oaky and simple, but with grilled meats it should more than do the trick. If you like 'em big and a touch funky, get tattooed.",87
Michael Schachner,Viña Santa Monica 2001 Chardonnay (Rapel Valley),"Heavy and gold in color, with aromas of browned butter, wheat and corn cakes. The bouquet and color are heavy, and so is the palate: There you get oak barrel and toast, but little to no fruit. Even the finish is woody, with just a hint of melon and banana. A good experimental wine for those eager to taste oak; otherwise steer clear.",87
,Wolff 2001 Dijon Clones Selection Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),"The new clone on the block finally makes it onto the front label. Soft and silky, this wine has cherry-berry flavors with an earthy streak of tobacco and sage. There are some firm tannins that kick in on the finish, which suggest six months of aging.",87
Michael Schachner,Errazuriz 2001 Cabernet Sauvignon (Aconcagua Valley),"The initial nosing reveals a char-broiled character along with maple. That nose turns even darker with airing, indicating that no barrel was spared in the making of this wine. The flavor profile is all dark berries and cream, with yet more wood at the heart. On the tail end, it's dry, broad and full of tannins and extract that coat the mouth. Best Buy.",87
Roger Voss,Girolamo Dorigo 2000 Chardonnay (Colli Orientali del Friuli),"A rich, aromatic, honeyed style of Chardonnay, with 100% malolactic fermentation to increase the softness and sweet wood flavors. Soft peach flavors increase the tropical intensity of the wine.",87
,Iron Horse 2002 Rose de Pinot Noir Pinot Noir (Green Valley),"As easy and tasty as a summer wine gets, this blush also has a lovely coppery-pink color. Flavors of fresh strawberries and spice burst on the palate, and drink just a tad off-dry.",87
,Opolo 2000 Pinot Noir (Central Coast),"From a vineyard in the Santa Lucia Highlands, a young, jammy wine bursting with candied flavors of raspberries and cherries. It drinks very concentrated and intense. There's a caramelly note that may come from well-charred barrels in this dry, full-bodied wine.",87
,Savannah-Chanelle 2000 Sleepy Hollow Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Tasty and wonderfully drinkable. The basic flavors are cola and soy, with extra nuances of blackberries, cherries and quite a bit of smoky, sweet oak. Drinks very dry and spicy.",87
Joe Czerwinski,Merk 2001 Tocai (Friuli Aquileia),"A taut, citrusy and minerally wine from a grape variety that's often more open and fruity, this offering is nonetheless impeccably fresh and clean, picking up some minty notes on the finish.",87
Michael Schachner,Morandé 2001 Edicion Limitada - 66 Barricas Cabernet Franc (Maipo Valley),"Some earthy, herbal cranberry scents are given life by a touch of smoky oak. The palate is sweet and wholesome, and very well balanced. The finish gives a hint of syrup and oak, but the fruit is ripe and succulent enough to handle that.",87
,J Vineyards & Winery 2002 Pinot Gris (Russian River Valley),"Almost addictive with its fresh, clean flavors of sweet lemon, fig, tart green apple and cinnamon, encased in lively acidity. This zesty white wine has extra layers of complexity and depth. It's also one of the most versatile food wines around.",87
Joe Czerwinski,Pradio 1999 Teraje Chardonnay (Friuli Grave),"Despite the modest price, this wine needs some time in the glass or in a decanter to open up. It starts off slowly, then builds pear and quince aromas and flavors through the long, tart, minerally finish. Best Buy.",87
Roger Voss,Masi 2002 Colbaraca Classico  (Soave),"A Soave that has been partially barrel fermented is unusual, but it works in this wine, which has great concentration, roundness and softness and the complexity of toast.",87
Joe Czerwinski,Masottina 2001 Vigneto Ai Palazzi Pinot Grigio (Piave),"This luscious, balanced Pinot Grigio isn't overly complex, but scores for its cactus pear and toasted almond aromas and flavors and its peppery, refreshing finish. It's medium-bodied, with just a hint of unreleased CO2 to enliven it.",87
Michael Schachner,Montes 2001 Alpha Syrah (Curicó Valley),"Solid and sturdy, and more big than small, this Syrah runs toward the red-fruit spectrum. But the nose offers dried fruit, herbs and clove, while there's more clove and fennel underneath the fruit on the palate. There's oak throughout, especially on the finish, but it's not overdone. And if many Syrah-based wines need time to settle, this one seems made for immediate drinking.",87
Michael Schachner,Concha y Toro 2002 Xplorador Merlot (Rapel Valley),"This Merlot excels beyond its bargain classification by showing purity and a high level of fruit quality. The bouquet exudes plum, chocolate and some creaminess, while the palate bursts with blackberry, bitter chocolate and espresso. Round and satisfying, with enough structure to last a year or two—or until the next vintage comes around.",87
Anne Krebiehl MW,Dopff & Irion 2014 Cuvée René Dopff Pinot Blanc (Alsace),"Friendly apple fruit sits easily on nose and palate before a refreshing, clean finish. This is an easy, fruit-driven white ideal for a party.",86
Roger Voss,Union de Vignerons de l'Île de Beauté 2015 Rosé (Ile de Beauté),"Made from the local Sciaccarellu grape, this is a delicious, light and perfumed wine. It has tight acidity to go with the red currant flavors and the crisp texture. The wine is poised and refreshing.",86
Jim Gordon,Van Ruiten 2015 Chardonnay (Lodi),"Lively aromas like crisp apple and white peach join more creamy, pastry-like flavors of butter, vanilla and toasted almond in this medium-bodied wine. It is soft in texture and so fruity it seems sweet on the finish.",86
Roger Voss,Vignobles Bonhur 2015 Château Terres Douces Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé),"This wine is tangy and textured with light tannins, a bite of citrus acidity and plenty of fruit. It's bright and has a juicy, lively aftertaste. Drink now.",86
Michael Schachner,Viña Otano 2014 Viura (Rioja),"Largely neutral on the nose, then tangy and still fresh on the palate, this drink-now Viura is clean but unexciting. Flavors of generic citrus finish firm, with a pithy aftertaste.",86
Kerin O’Keefe,MandraRossa 2015 Urra di Mare Sauvignon (Sicilia),"Aromas suggesting honeydew melon, exotic fruit and a hint of tomato leaf lead the nose. The simple palate is a bit less expressive, offering grapefruit and a hint of white peach alongside lively acidity.",86
Kerin O’Keefe,Mastroberardino 2013 Neroametà Aglianico (Campania),"Made with white vinification of Aglianico grapes, this has aromas of dried-up chamomile flower and overripe citrus fruit. The simple palate offers crushed white currant alongside zesty acidity.",86
Matt Kettmann,Joseph Filippi 2009 Old Vine Zinfandel (Cucamonga Valley),"In many ways, this is a fascinating sip, but the components are a bit confusing altogether. Aromas of minty berries, tobacco, rustic leather and a very strong camphor scent introduce the nose, and then a lively, quite foamy acidity consumes the palate, where flavors of sweet berries are cut by garden herbs and pepper. It's a little too overpowering.",86
Lauren Buzzeo,Le Petit Cochonnet 2015 Cabernet Sauvignon (Pays d'Oc),"A pleasant mix of dark berries and fruit lead the bouquet of this friendly wine, with solid notes of black cherry, blackberry and boysenberry throughout. A hint of spice adds interest to the finish, with medium-light tannins and ample acidity resulting in good overall balance.",86
Anne Krebiehl MW,Leon Beyer 2014 Pinot Blanc (Alsace),"A softly earthy tone is all the nose gives away. The palate is brisk, neutral and has both freshness and a slightly bitter edge. Drink soon.",86
Kerin O’Keefe,Terredora 2012 Campore  (Fiano di Avellino),"Toasted oak, citrus zest and honey aromas lead followed by a balsamic note. The palate offers walnut, oak and the barest hint of butterscotch but it lacks fruit richness.",86
Jim Gordon,Tortoise Creek 2014 Jam's Blend Chardonnay (Lodi),"This medium-bodied wine is very fruity in aroma, and exudes ripe pear and fig flavors. Add in creamy vanilla accents and a very soft texture and the effect is almost sweet.",86
Michael Schachner,Undurraga 2014 Gran Reserva Sibaris Pinot Noir (Leyda Valley),"Dusty earth, seashell notes and tomato aromas don't fully announce how snappy, tart and racy this coastal PN is. Almost sour red-plum and pie-cherry flavors finish angular, sharp and zesty to an extreme.",86
Virginie Boone,Vermeil 2013 Frediani Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Calistoga),"This is a juicy and formidably tannic version of the variety, from a famed vineyard known also for Zinfandel. Dry oak and intrusively harsh texture need mellowing before the more gentle notions of dried herb and black cherry can shine.",86
Michael Schachner,Viña Maipo 2015 Vitral Chardonnay (Chile),"Apple and citrus aromas are neither well defined nor overly aromatic. Fresh and juicy on the palate, this offers citrus peel and green melon flavors. Mild and short on the finish.",86
Jim Gordon,Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi 2013 Merlot (California),A soft fruitiness and smooth texture make this medium-bodied red easy to enjoy. Strawberry and cherry notes rest easily on a bed of light tannin that adds an appetizing mouthfeel.,86
Michael Schachner,Viñedos y Bodegas Pablo 2014 Menguante Garnacha (Cariñena),"Black cherry and plum aromas are solid. This is chunky and heavyset, but comfortable across the palate. Generic plum and berry flavors are pure, while this finishes plump, chunky and with a hint of chocolate.",86
Michael Schachner,Concha y Toro 2014 Reserva Casillero del Diablo Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Valley),"Aromas of herbal red fruits, tobacco and vanilla are basic and modest. This has a wiry, acidic mouthfeel and flavors of mixed herbs, tomato, pie cherry, red plum and olive. A fresh, racy finish is tangy and tomatoey.",86
Michael Schachner,Echeverria 2014 Reserva Merlot (Central Valley),"This might be a touch volatile at first, but saucy tomato-like aromas are offset by fresh red-plum notes. A tight and tannic palate softens with time in the glass, while berry flavors carry herb and spice notes onto a lightly herbal finish.",86
Anne Krebiehl MW,Famille Hauller 2015 Pinot Blanc (Alsace),"This is a very simple, friendly, fresh and lively white—easy to drink and enjoy with its lemony freshness. It's ideal for a party.",86
Virginie Boone,Black Stallion 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"This aromatic, medium-bodied white flirts with a distinct grassiness that can overwhelm, before settling into finer notions of grapefruit and stone fruit, as well as ripe, fleshy cantaloupe.",86
Michael Schachner,Bodega Volcanes de Chile 2013 Tectonia Pinot Noir (Bío Bío Valley),"Chunky aromas of tomato, saucy berry fruits, asphalt and tire rubber are somewhat harsh. Flat and lazy in feel, this chunky, full-bodied number from Bío Bío tastes of baked cherry and plum fruit. A finish with low acidity and not much kick is the ending.",86
Jim Gordon,Bota Box 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"Lively, spicy oak aromas, rich fruit flavors and a lightly tannic texture make this a well-balanced dry wine that will be great with burgers, ribs or carne asada burritos. The price can't be beat either.",86
Michael Schachner,Campellares 2014  Rioja,"Straightforward red-fruit aromas suggest cherry and plum. Rubbery, pinching tannins are the adhesive for this punchy young Rioja that tastes of raspberry and cherry and finishes steady.",86
Roger Voss,Château Côte Montpezat 2015 Le Canon de Côte Montpezat Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé),"Almost white in color, this wine is fruity and crisp with lemon and lime flavors. A light hint of a tannic structure also suggests minerality. The aftertaste is bright and packed with acidity.",86
Roger Voss,Château Léon 2015 Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé),"This pale-colored wine has a light, perfumed character. A blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, it is an attractive, bone-dry rosé, ripe with strawberry fruits, that will be best with food.",86
Kerin O’Keefe,Agricola Bellaria 2014 Oltre  (Greco di Tufo),"This opens with aromas that recall tropical fruit, hay and a whiff of chopped mint. The palate has weight and an almost oily texture but it lacks fruit richness, suggesting unripe pear, lemon zest and flint alongside brisk acidity.",86
Jeff Jenssen,Cramele Recas 2014 Legendary Estate Series Cabernet Sauvignon (Romania),"Aromas of black plum, black cherry, green bramble and a touch of eucalyptus precede flavors of blackberry, raspberry and red plum.",86
Jeff Jenssen,Cramele Recas 2014 Legendary Estate Series Pinot Grigio (Romania),"Pineapple, citrus blossom, and white peach aromas prepare your palate for tastes of green apple, lemon zest and apricots. The finish is crisp and acidic.",86
Jeff Jenssen,Cramele Recas 2015 Dreambird Merlot (Romania),Aromas of black berry and black cherry lead to flavors of cherry vanilla and red plum before a soft tannic finish.,86
Jim Gordon,Nica 2012 Chardonnay (California),Rich flavors like vanilla and fig combine with a creamy texture and sweet finish to make a cream puff of a wine. The texture is soft and acidity quite low.,84
Roger Voss,Producta Vignobles 2015 Cabane aux Oiseaux Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé),"The caramel character of this wine is less attractive than its background of red fruits. The two sides need to come into balance for it to work completely, so wait until late 2016.",84
Michael Schachner,Rio Madre 2014  Rioja,"Reedy red-fruit aromas lack the clarity that the best wines of this style show. Grabby on the palate, this tastes of basic plum and raspberry. A raw, tannic, rubbery finish is the final act.",84
Michael Schachner,Rios de Chile 2015 Chardonnay (Central Valley),"Bland, fleshy aromas of corn and apple cider are unconvincing but not overtly negative. This feels plump and heavy, like fruit punch. Flavors of cantaloupe and citrus fruits finish yeasty, with notes of corn and white bread.",84
Lauren Buzzeo,Le Petit Cochonnet 2015 Merlot (Pays d'Oc),"A very drinkable, light and easy to like Merlot, this offers ripe notes of black plum, cherry and berry on the nose and mouth, with a faint hint of milk chocolate in the background. The soft mouthfeel and fruity palate finish short, but clean.",84
Lauren Buzzeo,Le Petit Cochonnet 2015 Pinot Noir (Pays d'Oc),"A light, easy and cheery selection, with direct aromas and flavors of sweet cherry, red raspberry and strawberry. The mouthfeel is soft and approachable, with virtually no tannins and a clean, short finish. Drink up.",84
Michael Schachner,Loma Larga 2013 Unfiltered Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley),"There are a lot of uncommon, unusual elements to this Pinot. For starters, the nose is volatile, with notes of horseradish and grapefruit. The palate has a solid, juicy feel to it, while mulchy cherry and plum flavors finish aimlessly.",84
Jim Gordon,Los Portales 2013 Garnacha (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),"This wine smells fruity, like raspberry and cranberries, and turns very tart and astringent on the palate. Sharp fruit flavors come out on the finish along with a metallic edge.",84
Lauren Buzzeo,Maison Nicolas 2015 Rosé (Gard),"This is herbal and ripely fruited all at once, smelling like sweet pea, carnation and baby powder combined with tones of plum and cherry. The fruity notes continue through to the medium-weight palate, though they're short-lived.",84
Michael Schachner,Montebuena 2014 Cuvée KPF  (Rioja),"This light-bodied Rioja smells of cherry, plum and cotton candy. It's a bit thin on the palate but offers just enough body to be worthwhile. Mild plum and cherry flavors hollow out on the simple finish.",84
Michael Schachner,Montes 2014 Classic Series Merlot (Colchagua Costa),"Forced, candied aromas of chocolaty oak and herbal, slightly weedy berry fruits feed into a chunky, blocky, creamy palate with saucy berry flavors combined with minty, top-heavy oak. The finish tastes minty, lactic and oaky, with heat.",84
Michael Schachner,Rayun 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Valley),"Berry and cherry aromas register as soupy and flat. Like the nose, this feels flat, chewy and dense. Stewed, rubbery prunes and plums finish with a fig-like note and rubbery tannins.",84
Michael Schachner,Rios de Chile 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Central Valley),"Flat, dusty aromas of lees and vanilla cookies are rather lifeless. While this is wet and somewhat juicy in feel, it's bland as a whole, with yeasty melon and citrus flavors that finish bready.",84
Virginie Boone,River Road 2015 Un-Oaked Chardonnay (Sonoma County),"Fermented entirely in stainless steel, this is a simple, tropically sweet wine, characterized by mango, pineapple and juicy melon.",84
Jim Gordon,"Greenwood Ridge 2013 Hundred Point, Estate Bottled Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)","This medium-bodied wine has an earthy aroma, muted cherry flavors and a smooth enough texture. It is good and drinkable.",84
Jim Gordon,Housley's Century Oak 2013 Judy's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi),"This full-bodied wine has earthy, woodsy aromas, ripe and mature fruit flavors and a broad, almost soft texture. It's very mouth-filling and smooth, and will please people who like a little rusticity in their wines.",84
Jim Gordon,Twisted 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"Aromas like jam and maple syrup and equally ripe, generous flavors give this medium-bodied wine an easy appeal. The texture is soft for this type, the flavors are not too deep and the finish is light.",84
Michael Schachner,Valtravieso 2011 Vendimia Seleccionada  (Ribera del Duero),"Saucy aromas run low on fruit and high on tomato and green herbs. In the mouth, this feels rough. Flavors of bell pepper, pizza sauce and oregano finish without the ripeness that should be present in a high-end 2011 RDD.",84
Roger Voss,Château Lamothe-Vincent 2015 Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé),"This is a strawberry-pink-colored wine with candied flavors balanced by acidity. It is fruity, crisp and light in character.",84
Roger Voss,Château Laubès 2015 Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé),"With only the lightest texture, this wine almost tastes like a white wine. It has plenty of citrus character, partnered with apple and green-fruit flavors. At the end, look out for the bite of tannin that gives it a more rosé character.",84
Matt Kettmann,Four Sisters Ranch 2011 Serena's Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"Rather vegetal aromas of jalapeño and bell pepper mix with red fruit on the nose of this bottling. Those same bell peppery notes carry through the palate, which is intriguing but will likely confuse many drinkers.",84

Michael Schachner,G7 2013 The 7th Generation Reserva Carmenère (Loncomilla Valley),"Woody, creamy aromas of black fruits precede a sketchy palate with acidity akin to vinegar. Medicinal flavors of oak, mint and generic berry fruits finish with a pasty feel and herbal, oaky flavors.",84
Michael Schachner,Albamar 2015 Estate Bottled Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley),"Prickly, punchy, pryazinic aromas will have you thinking this is Sauvignon Blanc or Spanish Verdejo. A sharp palate is more about acid than body, while this continues with its SB-like character via green flavors of lime and arugula. A crisp finish evaporates into nothing.",83
Michael Schachner,Indomita 2015 Gran Reserva Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley),"Heavy oak and marginal white-fruit scents make for a compromised nose.

Matt Kettmann,Loft 2014 Chardonnay (Monterey),"Apple and honeydew aromas show on the nose of this boxed wine, which prides itself on having a small eco-footprint. The palate is flatter than the nose, with green apple skin flavors but not much texture or acidity to speak of.",83
Michael Schachner,Santa Alicia 2015 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Maipo Valley),"Underripe aromas of bell pepper and scallion correctly announce a shearing, high-acid palate. Salty, tart flavors of citrus fruits finish with pyrazine-driven green notes.",83

Michael Schachner,Kunza 2012 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Maule Valley),"Rustic, gaseous aromas of soupy berry fruits and tire rubber create a struggling nose. Rubbery tannins and a lack of a focal point make for a jumbled palate, while this tastes stewy, weedy and low on fresh fruit.",83
Roger Voss,Herdade dos Machados 2009 Morgado da Canita Red (Alentejano),"This feels very ripe, perhaps overripe, with its seemingly sweet flavor of black fruit juice and its soft structure. It's appealing and does have some tannins, but it is not for aging.",84
,Pazzo 2009 Red (Napa Valley),"From Bacio Divino, this Sangiovese-based blend is curiously soft. While it has forward cherry, cocoa and spice flavors, it simply lacks structural integrity.The alcohol is evident on the warm, dry finish.",84
Roger Voss,Quinta de Gomariz 2011 Espadeiro Rosé (Vinho Verde),This is a fresh and fragrant rosé from the Vinho Verde region. It has light acidity and a red fruit flavor. The lightest prickle gives just that extra lift.,84

,Vignobles Garrigae 2010 Seigneurie de Peyrat Tradition Chardonnay-Viognier (Pays d'Oc),"Vanilla and toasted almond aromas evolve into a scent of tarte tatin. Full bodied, with warm alcohol, this shows medium fruit concentration. The acidity is borderline in its balance, leaning to flabiness. The tactile heat on the medium finish is distracting.",84
,Walt 2010 Hein Family Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"The first noticeable aspect is that it seems to have no structure. The cherry, cola and pomegranate flavors have been elaborately oaked, but there's nothing for the mouth to grip onto.",84
,Plungerhead 2010 Old Vine Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),The mouthfeel has sandpapery tannins and some green peppercorn notes alongside riper flavors of blackberries and sweet currants. It's a rustic Zin to drink with barbecue.,84

Paul Gregutt,Ken Wright 2011 Shea Vineyard Pinot Noir,"A return to elegance, this aromatic, inviting wine suggests ripe fruit dusted with cocoa powder. Raspberries pack a juicy wallop, balanced against hints of clean earth and ripe tannins.",91
Paul Gregutt,Market Vineyards 2009 Benchmark Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is done in an open, palate-friendly style, with rich, generous black fruits accented with cocoa, coffee and caramel. There's a streak of vanilla custard also, and the fruit has enough depth and mass to hold up through a satisfying finish.",91
,MCV 2011 Rosewynn Vineyard Petite Sirah (Paso Robles),"Shows Petite Sirah's tremendous power, with full-bodied blackberry jam, black currant, dark chocolate and pepper flavors, and there's a wonderful meatiness suggesting charred beef fat. The alcohol is high, yet the wine is measured, with firm, ripe tannins. Really a fine expression of Petite Sirah, Paso-style.",91
Virginie Boone,Terre Rouge 2011 Viognier (Fiddletown),"From rocky estate soils, Terre Rouge's Viognier opens with delicious aromas of honeysuckle, mango and guava, lightly put together with a jolt of wet stone. Rich in mouthfeel, the finish is woodsy, like the finest herb garden.",91
,V. Sattui 2009 Paradiso Red (Napa Valley),"The winery pulled out all the stops on this Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend, yet the wine is so tannic and sharp now. Shows massively extracted black currant and oak flavors that run deep and long in the finish. Who knows what this wine might do in 10–15 years, but it's a roll of the dice.",91
,Westerly 2010 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Give this brisk, young Pinot 5–6 years in the cellar to mellow. It's clearly a very fine wine, clean and elegantly constructed, with rich tannins and a bright squirt of acidity framing ripe cherry, currant and licorice flavors.",91
,Whitcraft 2011 Pence Ranch Pinot Noir (Santa Ynez Valley),"Give this lovely Pinot Noir a few hours in the decanter and serve now with your best lamb and steak entrées. It's dry, refined in the acid-tannin balance and deliciously complex, with waves of raspberries and cherries, pie crust, baking spices and toasted oak.",91
,Nicora 2010 Euphoric La Vista Vineyard Grenache-Syrah (Paso Robles),"This wine is frankly high in alcohol, clocking in at 16% by volume. But it's also incredibly delicious, offering soft waves of milk chocolate, black cherry jam, red currants, bacon and black pepper. Drink this wine at night, with rich stews or barbecue, but be careful about driving.",91
,Nicora 2010 G-S-M (Paso Robles),"Softly tannic, rich and enormously enjoyable, this Rhône-style blend offers lush flavors of raspberries, cherries, milk chocolate, crispy bacon, black pepper and sandalwood. The alcohol is heady, but balanced with fine acidity. Drink over the next two years for freshness.",91
Virginie Boone,Black Kite 2010 Redwood's Edge Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"A block of vines set literally near a grove of Redwood trees, the 2010 Redwood's Edge is structured and slightly austere and elusive, a concentrated rendering of deep, dark red fruit, lavender and woody undertones that's incredibly delicious.",91
Paul Gregutt,Bunnell 2009 Grenache (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Spicy and floral, with pretty cherry fruit concentrated at the core, this inviting Grenache combines grace and power. The flavors are complex and concentrated, with hints of green tea, cut tobacco, and a finishing streak of espresso and cocoa.",91
Roger Voss,Château la Varière 2009 Les Melleresses  (Bonnezeaux),"A super-rich wine, almost over the top in its honeyed intensity. It is opulent, generous, packed with ripe yellow fruits, mango and pineapple. The wine is so rich that it is hard to find the acidity, but it is there in the orange marmalade flavor right at the end.",91
Roger Voss,Château Lagrézette 2010 Château Chevaliers Lagrézette Malbec (Cahors),"This wine from Château Lagrézette is powerful and dense in its own right. It has black, juicy, tar-like flavors with tannins concentrated into a dry, dark core. Blended with a small proportion of Merlot, there is just a touch of softness which will allow the wine to mature in the next 2–3 years.",91
Roger Voss,Château Saint-Didier-Parnac 2011 Prieuré de Cénac Malbec (Cahors),"A dark, brooding wine, packed with firm tannins and solid plum-skin and licorice flavors. The wine is dense and complex—a powerful evocation of Malbec—allowing the juicy fruits to merge with the young structure that needs agng for at least 4–5 years.",91
,Contadi Castaldi 2008 Zero Sparkling (Franciacorta),"This edition of Dosaggio Zero shows delicate harmony and complexity with layers of stone fruit, citrus, almond and white flower. Zesty perlage is enhanced by more stone fruit flavors on the silky finish.",91
Roger Voss,Domaine de Cause 2009 Notre Dame de Champs Malbec (Cahors),"The top wine from Domaine de Cause, it's huge, very dense and concentrated. There is a sense of extraction, showcased by the licorice and dark chocolate flavors. This needs to calm down to give the rich fruits a chance to shine. Give this wine 6–7 years.",91
Michael Schachner,Losada 2013 El Pájaro Rojo Mencía (Bierzo),"Reduced, floral and plummy on the nose, this is a simple, blocky, tannic young wine. Medicinal berry flavors finish loud and grapy, with a grabby, tacky feel. Fruit outweighs finesse.",86
Roger Voss,Manuel Olivier 2012 Vieilles Vignes  (Bourgogne Hautes Côtes de Nuits),"In this case, Vieilles Vignes (old vines) only means vines over 20 years. The wine is soft, rounded and full of red cherry fruitiness. Judicious wood aging has rounded the wine out while leaving all its fruit intact. It can be drunk now, but will be better from 2016.",86
Sean P. Sullivan,Windy Bay 2012 Pinot Noir (Oregon),"Aromatically appealing, it features notes of allspice, herbs, cola and cherry. The palate is lighter in style with a scrape-y feel, not fully delivering on all that the aromas have to offer.",86
Roger Voss,Vignerons de Buxy 2012 Buissonnier  (Mercurey),"This light-colored wine has a spicy character that points up the tannins as well as the red berry fruits. It has a light feeling, with refreshing acidity that shows strongly at the end. It's ready to drink.",86
Kerin O’Keefe,Villa Girardi 2010  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,"Aromas of tobacco leaf, wet soil, mature plum, resin and a whiff of barnyard lead the nose on this full-bodied wine. The palate offers dried prune layered with notes of chocolate and grilled sage. The fleeting finish closes on a rather bitter note.",86
Roger Voss,Wines & Winemakers 2013 Lua Cheia em Vinhas Velhas Album Antão Vaz (Alentejano),"Yellow fruits and apple juice combine in this fresh, mineral-driven wine. It's tangy, tight with acidity while allowing room for pineapple and tropical flavors at the end. It's ready to drink but will be better in 2016.",86
Matt Kettmann,Clos La Chance 2010 Amber's Cuvee Sparkling (Santa Cruz Mountains),"A faint hint of pink shines on this sparkler named after the winery owners' dog. Aromas of fresh melon and slight peach lead to a faint cherry note upon sipping and creamy mouthfeel, followed by plum skin tartness and a yeasty, sour bitterness.",86
Michael Schachner,Pagos del Rey 2008 Arnegui Reserva  (Rioja),"Wiry cherry aromas are a touch cheesy and also medicinal. This is pinched and astringent, with a choppy mix of buttery red-berry flavors and vanilla. Like most 2008s, this finishes hard and abrupt, with staunch tannins.",86
Roger Voss,Quinta de Covela 2013 Covela Rosé (Minho),"Made principally from Touriga Nacional, this is a rich wine with attractive acidity and strawberry fruitiness. It is ripe, touched with caramel and finished with wild raspberry flavors.",86
Kerin O’Keefe,Ricci Curbastro 2009 Extra Brut Sparkling (Franciacorta),"Subdued aromas recall white flower and stone fruit. The muted palate reveals mature yellow apple skin, lemon zest and notes of nut butter alongside sharp bubbles. It has a tangy but fleeting finish.",86
Roger Voss,Ruhlmann NV Signature Brut Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace),"This is fresh, not quite dry and a fine apéritif wine. With its soft texture, apple fruits and light mousse, it's both fruity and crisp, with a rounded, fragrant aftertaste.",86
Roger Voss,Dopff & Irion NV Brut Rosé Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace),"Crisp and textured, this offers plenty of fresh apple and red fruit flavors. It's a light, bright wine that's poised and stylish, in a fine apéritif style.",86
Sean P. Sullivan,Foris 2012 Maple Ranch Estate Pinot Noir (Rogue Valley),"Vibrantly fruity, it offers aromas of currant, raspberry, celery stalk and spice. The palate has tart cranberry flavors, finishing a bit short.",86
Michael Schachner,Vega Sindoa 2012 El Chaparral Old Vines Garnacha (Navarra),"This Garnacha is heavily oaked.Smoky, woody aromas come with dusty berry notes, while the palate is heavy, with cheek-smacking tannins. Flavors of hickory and roasted blackberry finish with another creamy, woody dose of oak.",86
Kerin O’Keefe,Il Mosnel 2010 Brut Satèn Chardonnay (Franciacorta),"This toasty bottling shows some evident maturity in terms of fruit richness. It offers toasted walnut, espresso, vanilla and yellow apple-skin flavors alongside large, brisk bubbles and crisp acidity.",86
Roger Voss,Jaffelin 2013 Les Villages de Jaffelin  (Mâcon-Péronne),"One of the lesser-known of the many Mâcon appellations, Péronne is close to Clessé. The wine is smooth, ripe and fruity, with a creamed pear and lightly lemon flavor. With a hint of minerality, it could age until 2016.",86
Roger Voss,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2012 Clos des Rois Premier Cru  (Maranges),"From the recent appellation at the southern end of the Côte de Beaune, this is a light and very fruity wine with little discernible tannin or structure. Red cherries and fresh acidity dominate and the wine should be drunk young.",86
Michael Schachner,Lealtanza 2011 Crianza  (Rioja),"This starts out savory and smoky on the nose, but with airing it turns murky. The palate is tight in structure, with red-fruit acidity. Flavors of cherry, raspberry and oaky vanilla turn roasted and stalky as this unwinds on a fresh-feeling finish.",86
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Maximin Grünhäuser 2012 Herrenberg Alte Reben Trocken Riesling (Mosel),"Dust and pollen notes linger from nose to finish on this dry, full-bodied Riesling. Apple and pear flavors are a tad savory, but brightened by crisp lemon acidity. A refreshing and easy drinking wine.",86
Michael Schachner,Aldonia 2012 Vendimia  (Rioja),"Dusty, medicinal berry and plum aromas are open and bright. A juicy but pinched palate features narrow flavors of plum and berry skins, while the finish is rubbery in feel, with astringency as well as bright residual fruit flavors.",86
Kerin O’Keefe,Altemasi 2010 Brut Chardonnay (Trento),"Aromas of peach blossom, citrus and a yeasty note of fresh biscuits lead the nose on this 100% Chardonnay. The palate offers walnut husk, lemon zest and a confectionary note alongside sharp acidity.",86
Virginie Boone,Ancient Oak Cellars 2011 Siebert Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Soft and supple, this has a heavy streak of spearmint and an herbal finish that also offers dark black cherry and ripe, leathery tannins.",86
Michael Schachner,Cellers Baronia del Montsant 2010 Englora Red (Montsant),"Reduced, stewy, lightly herbal aromas blend berry and tomato scents. The acidity on this five-grape blend is pointed and overriding. Flavors of herbal berry and currant are tangy but also stewy, while the finish is long and green in flavor.",86
Virginie Boone,Benziger 2012 Appellation Series Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This is a fairly light, bright Pinot Noir with the marks of a ripe year and time spent in oak. It is crafted under the guidelines of a certified sustainable grape growing program. Medium-bodied and juicy, it's fairly priced and ready to enjoy now.",86
Roger Voss,Herdade do Rocim 2013 Olho de Mocho Rosé (Alentejano),"Soft and ripe, this has strawberry fruit flavors, a soft texture and a warm, rich feel. There is just enough acidity to balance this really food-friendly rosé.",86
Kerin O’Keefe,Le Bertarole 2010 Podere Cariano  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),"Rustic aromas recall wet earth, barnyard and leather with a whiff of ripe, black fruit. The thick palate is rather muddled and delivers both sweet and bitter sensations of prune, overripe black plum, confectionary flavors, vanilla and notes of resin alongside astringent tannins that dry out the mouth.",86
Roger Voss,Poças NV Poças Pink  (Port),"The pink hue is a little flat. That also applies to the palate, with the fruit showing some maturity and hinting at wood aging. It's a rounded style, full in the mouth, with ripe caramel flavors at the end. Drink now.",86
Roger Voss,Quintas de Melgaço 2013 QM Blue White (Vinho Verde),"Light and bright, this has a crisp prickle on the tongue, along with canned grapefruit and tight apple-skin flavors. It is almost dry, which gives the wine a mineral texture that adds a bite. Drink now.",86
,Augusta Winery 2008 Seyval Blanc (Augusta),"A pretty, grapey wine with tones of pine and lemon underlying flavors of green plum and quince. It's flavorful, off-dry and refreshing; a good expression of Seyval Blanc.",84
,Bella 2007 Lily Hill Estate Syrah (Dry Creek Valley),"A little too dry and tannic, with earthy flavors of tobacco, sage, pepper and dried leather, which only partially relieve the modest blackberries and black currants. Way too astringent all the way through.",84
Michael Schachner,Carmen 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Curicó Valley),"Dusty apple aromas are less citrusy than ideal, and the palate is cidery and tangy. Finishes with heft, length and weight, which all seems a little overbearing given the wine's simplicity. Just good enough but doesn't fully click.",84
Michael Schachner,Pulenta Estate 2008 La Flor Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),"Foxy and jumpy smelling at first, with brambly raspberry aromas. The palate feels heavy and baked, with grabby tannins in support of herbal, mildly weedy berry fruit flavors. Finishes saucy, with a hint of tomato. Not pure and focused like the La Flor Malbec.",84
Roger Voss,Simonnet-Febvre 2007 Sauvignon de Saint-Bris  (Saint-Bris),"In a piece of French wine shorthand, the new appellation of Saint-Bris takes in the old Sauvignon de Saint-Bris wines. The style, though, hasn't changed: an attractive, if rustic type, with crisp gooseberry and grapefruit flavors and a fresh burst of acidity. Screwcap.",84
,Williamson Wines 2006 Clarissa Vin Rouge Red (Dry Creek Valley),"Dry and rough in texture, with berry, cherry, tobacco, herb and spice flavors wrapped into edgy, slightly green tannins. Turns sharp on the finish, and not likely to age.",84
,Mendocino Farms 2005 Heart Arrow Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendocino),"Dry, with thick tannins housing blackberry, herb and olive flavors. Drink now.",84
,Messina Hof 2009 Muscat Canelli (Texas),"Charming and perfumed, with notes of musk, white flowers and wild grapes on the nose and exotic spices in the mouth. This is not a concentrated wine, but there's enough acidity here to balance the slight sweetness and to make it a refreshing apéritif. Drink up.",84
Michael Schachner,Morandé 2008 Pionero Merlot (Rapel Valley),"Berry, pickle and bramble aromas are a little tough and crusted over, while the palate is snappy and fresh in feel, with flavors of herbal berry fruit and pepper. A mild hint of oak and resin dry up the finish.",84
,La Chiripada 2007 Artist Series 1 Dolcetto (New Mexico),"The nose is honest and bright but not terribly expressive, with just a few delicate raspberry and cherry tones. In the mouth, bing cherry and damp earth notes takes over and continue on the medium finish. Try with a veal chop. Drink up.",84
,Howling Moon 2008 Chardonnay (Lodi),"A good, dry Chardonnay that gets the job done at a fair price. Shows peaches and cream flavors with a bit of sharpness and green herbs on the finish.",84
,La Storia 2006 Cuvee 32 Red (Alexander Valley),"A raw, rustic blend based on Sangiovese and Merlot, this wine is very dry and astringent in tannins. It's an old-fashioned wine that's technically without flaws.",84
Michael Schachner,Luigi Bosca 2009 Finca la Linda Chardonnay (Luján de Cuyo),"Basic apricot and peach aromas lead to melon, banana and pithy flavors. The palate is a little thick and mealy, while the finish has pretty good feel and length, but not much flavor. Slightly tropical and simple.",84
Michael Schachner,O. Fournier 2007 Urban Uco Tempranillo (Uco Valley),"Sharp, minty aromas mixed with stemmy red fruit set up a modest, middleweight palate of semisweet, generic red fruit flavors. Quick on the finish, with a spot of green flavor. Good enough but lacks the concentration and deeper aromas and flavors of Urban Malbec.",84
,Pahrump Valley Winery 2005 Nevada Ridge First Crush Zinfandel (Nevada),"A luxurious mouthfeel and good concentration are this wine's chief attractions. Flavors are more earthy than fruity, with tones of compost and stewed prunes. Medium finish shows ripe but slightly drying tannins. Drink now.",84
,Sobon Estate 2008 Viognier (Amador County),"Slightly sweet, with a honeyed edge to the rich pear, apple, peach and tropical fruit flavors. Just-in-time acidity fortunately provides balance.",84
,Terre Rouge 2007 Tete-a-Tete Red (Sierra Foothills),"Despite some black cherry richness, there's a green, minty, stalky note of unripeness in this blend of Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre that limits its appeal. Decanting doesn't help and neither will aging.",84
,Three Fox 2007 Il Volpe Sangiovese (Virginia),"There is potential in this wine that bodes well for the future of Sangiovese in Virginia. The nose is charming, with mocha, fall leaves and cherries that slide into a silky palate with woodsy touches. Juicy, raspberry-inflected finish. Try with steak. Drink now.",84
,Castello di Borghese 2006 Founder's Field Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (North Fork of Long Island),"Clove and vanilla make for a serious, if not terribly refreshing, opening. There's nice grapefruit and pomelo fruit here and a medium, lemony finish that veers towards tart. Drink up.",84
Paul Gregutt,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2006 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is a simple, light take on Syrah, with a little bit of black pepper, a hint of underbrush, but none of the texture and detail of pricier Washington bottles. It's a light, pleasant red, fine for pizza night.",84
Michael Schachner,Doña Paula 2009 Los Cardos Sauvignon Blanc (Mendoza),"Aromas of white grapefruit, celery and other prickly fruits lose steam with airing, while the green apple and lime flavors are solid and offer some sweetness. Wet in the mouth, which is what you want, but standard fare as a whole.",84
,Easton 2007 Cooper Ranch Barbera (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),"Acidity dominates this wine, giving it a tart, almost sour taste. Couple that with the sizable tannins, and you have an uncomfortable wine. Call it rustic, old world. The blackberry, currant, coffee and herb flavors are fine.",84
Paul Gregutt,Gilbert Cellars 2007 Cabernet Franc (Wahluke Slope),"Even grapier than the Cabernet Sauvignon, this forward, light, candied, confected wine has a hole in the middle. The tannins turn quite astringent, a marked contrast to the sweetness of the fruit.",84
,Glenora 2007 Mason Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Finger Lakes),"Readily likeable, with a nose of summer fruit soup layered over notes of field greens. The texture is lazy, with moderate acidity and almost no tannin. Try with ribs in a sweet barbecue sauce. Drink now.",84
,Glenora 2008 Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Confected but pleasant aromas of cotton candy and sour apple drops dominate the nose, while the palate unfolds nicely with layers of lemon and red apple. Soft and lush, it picks up an apricot accent on the medium finish. Try with Thai food. Drink now.",84
Michael Schachner,Finca Sophenia 2009 Altosur Sauvignon Blanc (Tupungato),"Lime and green melon aromas are a bit less than clean and pure, and the palate serves up a pile of jalapeño and bell pepper, with some lime in the background. Short on the finish, and kind of dilute.",83
Paul Gregutt,Gilbert Cellars 2007 Estate Malbec (Wahluke Slope),"This vineyard has proven it can ripen good Malbec, but here it seems as if something has gone sideways. There is a gluey scent underneath the blackberry fruit, and the wine seems chalky and disjointed in the mouth, with more of the band-aid flavors in the finish.",83
Joe Czerwinski,Woolundry Rd 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (South Australia),"This wine is a bit hard and ungenerous but certainly not lacking in concentration or intensity. Cassis and cedar scents give way to dark, chocolaty flavors. There's not a lot of bright fruit or nuance, but it will ably partner simple grilled meats.",86
Paul Gregutt,Anam Cara 2005 Nicholas Estate Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This is a pretty wine, and the initial flavors are soft and mature, suggesting a wine that's ready to drink now. In the mouth it falls away quickly with a slightly oxidized character that suggests an early fade is on the way. It's gentle and drinks well enough right now, with some barrel notes of caramel and coffee beefing up the finish.",86
Paul Gregutt,Archery Summit 2004 Premier Cuvée Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"An exotic bouquet suggests dried roses, brown sugar, cranberry and plum jam. There's a sweetness in the mouth that continues the impression of brown sugar, or maybe a streak of cola. It's an interesting bottle that could develop further or fall off a cliff; it turns a little funky in the finish. More than 12,000 cases were made.",86
,Cartlidge & Browne 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"A solid entry into the everyday Cabernet sweepstakes. Shows ripe, juicy blackberry, cassis and spice flavors in a smooth, polished texture whose tannins cry out for steaks and chops.",86
Joe Czerwinski,Ceravolo 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Adelaide Plains),"Features pleasant but slightly simple flavors of candied cherries and cedar, with a smooth mouthfeel and just a hint of tannin on the finish. Drink now. Imported by Walca International.",86
Michael Schachner,Doña Paula 2006 Los Cardos Syrah (Luján de Cuyo),"Mildly smoky and toasty aromas lead to a lightly oaked palate that's largely defined by black cherry and some rich berry syrup. It's a full, colorful Syrah with a chunky mouthfeel and a satisfying but short finish. Drink now.",86
,Kenwood 2004 Reserve Merlot (Sonoma County),"Tasted in October, this still-young Merlot is tannic and jammy. It shows fresh primary fruit flavors of raspberries, cherries and blackberries that are a bit one-dimensional. Give it until mid-2008 to develop some bottle complexity.",86
Joe Czerwinski,Leeuwin Estate 2003 Prelude Vineyards Cabernet Merlot (Margaret River),"There's a tobacco and tomato leaf character that gives this an almost floral aroma, but also simpler cassis and cherry fruit. Some herbal notes persist on the palate, but this medium-bodied wine avoids the vegetal side of things, finishing fresh and clean.",86
,Parkers Estate 2005 Riverside Crossing Syrah (Sonoma County),"Nice and drily balanced, this is pretty tannic, with blackberry, cherry, leather, carob, coffee and peppery spice flavors that finish with an intriguing touch of tangerine rind. Drink now.",86
Joe Czerwinski,Pearson Vineyards 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Clare Valley),"This is a perfectly fine example of Clare Valley Cabernet, one that emphasizes refinement and elegance over sheer power and intensity. Cassis, tobacco and a hint of vanilla account for the bulk of the aromatic and flavor interest, and it turns mouthwatering on the finish. Should hold well through 2015.",86
Roger Voss,Simonnet-Febvre 2006  Chablis,"A ripe, crisp, very fresh Chablis bursting with green fruits, with a light layer of caramel and green herbs. Delicious now.",86
Michael Schachner,Campos Góticos 2003 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero),"In accordance to what 2003 dealt out, this wine is a bit stewy and broad. It shows cola, tree bark and baked fruit on the nose, and then sweet plum and chocolate on the finish. It's not a wine for deep contemplation; drink now to enjoy its robust plumpness.",86
,Frostwatch 2005 Chardonnay (Bennett Valley),"Lots to like in this dry, fruity Chardonnay. It has flavors of tropical fruits, buttered toast and caramel, wrapped into a rich, creamy mouthfeel. But it's pretty acidic, if you're sensitive to prickliness in your wines.",86
Michael Schachner,Vinos Sanz 2006 Montesol Verdejo (Rueda),"Slightly warmer in style, with caramel and vanilla aromas, yet the palate runs more toward freshness, with orange and pineapple standing out. With its good acidity and zest, this wine won't ever be called flabby. Drink now for solid results.",86
,Abbazia Santa Anastasia 2006 Sinestesìa White (Sicilia),"This is a blend of Inzolia and Sauvignon from a producer located high up the steep mountains above Cefalù on Sicily's western flank with cool nighttime temperature and soothing breezes. Straightforward aromas include green herb, white stone and citrus.",86
Michael Schachner,Pascual Toso 2007 Maipu Vineyards Sauvignon Blanc (Mendoza),"Better than most Argentinean Sauvignon Blancs, and made in a fuller-bodied style. The nose has weight and wax aromas, as well as melon, and the palate features ripe, almost pithy citrus. Dried apricot and a nick of passion fruit work the finish. Drink immediately.",85
Joe Czerwinski,Red Mud 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (South Australia),"Shows some slightly green tomato-leaf and bell-pepper notes as well as hints of leather and hung game, but despite all that, there's also ripe cassis and chocolate flavors and a supple mouthfeel. Imported by MHW,Ltd.",85
,Abbazia Santa Anastasia 2006 Baccante White (Sicilia),"From one of Sicily's most beautiful and promising vineyards, Baccante is a blend of Grillo and Chardonnay with bright clean acidity and fragrant yellow fruit. The only setback here is a matchstick aroma (not present in past years) that prevents this vintage from scoring higher.",85
Paul Gregutt,Archery Summit 2004 Renegade Ridge Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"A light entry holds flavors of strawberry and tomato leaf, then turns tannic. Chewy and earthy, with more than a hint of seed and stem, this wine comes from biodynamically farmed grapes that add some earthy nuances, but put too much emphasis on green tea, stemmy flavors.",85
,Castoro Cellars 2005 Cobble Creek Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"Earthy, soft and dry, this Zin has tobacco, cherry, blackberry and spice flavors, with an edge of sweet leather and pine. It's a refreshingly simple country-style Zin that will be nice with barbecue.",85
,French Hill 2005 Grand Reserve Barbera (Sierra Foothills),"Tastes young, sharp in acids and jammy sweet right now, with upfront cherry, raspberry and blackberry flavors. But after all, it is a California Barbera, and these puppies age forever. Give it some time, but don't expect it ever to become sophisticated.",85
Michael Schachner,Vitis Terrarum 2003 Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),"There's some stewed fruit weighing down this Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon blend, but for the most part it has it going on. Coffee, oak and leather aromas set up a palate of raspberry, plum and chocolate. There's a fair amount of acid for an ‘03, and that lends legs to a wine that might otherwise seem tired.",85
Joe Czerwinski,Vasse River 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Margaret River),"Seems rather oak-dominated, boasting ample brown sugar, vanilla and dill scents backed my some briary, blackberry fruit. Fills out a bit with air, so decant an hour or so prior to serving. Drink now.",85
,Kaleidos 2004 Morpheus Red (Paso Robles),"Like a trip through an orchard, this Syrah, Grenache and Mourvèdre blend bursts with flavors of cherries, raspberries, blackberries, tangerines, kumquats, dates, golden mangoes, yellow currants, the list goes on and on. It's a little on the sweet side, while grippy tannins give the palate handrails to negotiate this fruity ride.",85
Susan Kostrzewa,Lovingston 2005 Josie's Knoll Merlot (Monticello),"This is a pretty eastern U.S. Merlot, with its subtle, nuanced flavors of red berry, plum and currant and its approachable, soft tannins. Virginia is showing its talent for growing reds and this is a good example of what can be done with good vineyard management and winemaking.",85
,Sonoma Crest 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),"With polished blackberry, cherry and oak flavors, this affordable Cab represents a good value. It's soft, dry and stylish, and easy to drink.",85
Roger Voss,Château Haut Cabut 2014  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux,"This ripe and spicy wine from the Dop family's 27 acres offers layers of black fruits. It has a concentrated texture and a firm structure that is juicy while dense. With this richness, the wine will develop into a smooth and generous wine. Drink from 2019.",91
Roger Voss,Château le Pey 2014  Médoc,"This Cru Bourgeois estate has produced a structured wine that is still showing strong wood-aging flavors. Toasty as well as ripely fruity, it has firm tannins and good aging potential. The aftertaste is fruity and spicy. Drink from 2019.",91
Roger Voss,Château Montlandrie 2014  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux,"This vineyard is at one of the highest Castillon points. Big in tannins and also fruit, this is a dense wine. It has a dry core as well as rich blackberry fruits. Concentrated and full, the wine will be seriously worth drinking from 2019.",91
Roger Voss,Clos Puy Arnaud 2014  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux,"Owner Thierry Valette has been around the Right Bank (the family owned Pavie and owns Troplong Mondot) and, as a consultant, the world. Here he offers a delicious juicy wine with fine tannins and ripe red fruits. It has mint and spice perfumes along with balanced acidity. Drink this attractive wine from 2018.",91
Roger Voss,Closerie du Bailli 2014 Grande Réserve  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux),"This Alliance Bourg co-op wine is packed with minty new-wood aromas, this has the potential to be a smooth, polished wine. The blend is 70% Merlot, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Cabernet Franc. Firm tannins at this stage do not mask the ripe blackberry fruits. Give this wine until 2019 before drinking.",91
Anne Krebiehl MW,Domaine François Schmitt NV Blanc de Noirs Brut Pinot Noir (Alsace),"Intense notes of ripe red and baked apples make a strong impression. The palate is rich with the same baked apple along with a touch of honey and gingerbread. The yeasty flavors of autolysis provide an ideal backdrop for this structured, grown-up and classy wine. The finish is totally dry and wonderfully long.",91
Joe Czerwinski,Penley Estate 2012 Special Select Shiraz (Coonawarra),"You've got to like oak to appreciate this wine, which is presently dominated by scents of vanilla, mocha and toasted coconut. It's full bodied and velvety in texture, with hints of black cherry lurking in the background.",91
Joe Czerwinski,Penley Estate 2013 Hyland Shiraz (Coonawarra),"Mouthfilling and round, this wine's savory notes of roasted meat, mocha and cracked pepper frame plummy fruit. Vanilla creeps in on the long, supple finish. Drink now through 2025.",91
Virginie Boone,Miro 2014 Orsi Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This thick, concentrated wine offers complex notions of sandalwood and soapstone, savory in pleasant ways. Clove accents the warmth of strawberry compote laced in rhubarb.",91

Jim Gordon,Obsidian Ridge 2012 Half Mile 2640' Red (Red Hills Lake County),"This big, dramatic wine has a dark color and bold aromas of wood smoke and black pepper. Flavors are concentrated but also dry and appetizing. Firm tannins add grip and seem to help the peppery, smoky accents linger on the finish. Best after 2020.",91
Matt Kettmann,Opolo 2014 Summit Creek Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"Although one of the cheaper Zins in the winery's line-up, it is showing the best right now, so drink up. Black cherry, licorice, smoked beef and a deep hibiscus note make for a very heady nose. There is a dense yet soft character to the well-structured palate, where strong flavors of blueberry, crushed slate, tobacco, leather and wild herbs make a tasty convergence.",91
Kerin O’Keefe,Paltrinieri 2013 Grosso Metodo Classico  (Lambrusco di Modena),"Enticing scents of fragrant blue flower, red berry and baking spice lift out of the glass.

Anna Lee C. Iijima,Reichsgraf von Kesselstatt 2015 RK Riesling (Mosel),"Superbly warm weather in 2015 gave an extra boost of sunshine to many of the Mosel's entry-level wines, and the RK is one of the best. Whiffs of freesia and tangerine peel waft from the glasss of this semidry Riesling. It's low in alcohol, yet so honeyed and ripe that flavors of grapefruit and peach seem to slick sumptuously on the palate. Zesty lime acidity freshens a lingering finish.",91
Paul Gregutt,Rex Hill 2015 Pinot Noir Rosé (Willamette Valley),"This sensational effort was fermented and briefly aged in neutral oak. The striking package sets it apart from all other Rex Hill wines, and the rich, complex flavors add to the impression that this is something truly special. Red berries, blood orange, a touch of Grand Marnier, impressive body and spicy highlights all combine in a darn near irresistible rosé with the power to be a four season wine.",91
Virginie Boone,Robert Biale 2014 Founding Farmers Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"This rich, rewarding wine pleases in baked blueberry pie and a taste of raisin cake, its texture underlined in soft, integrated oak and a velvety density. Cinnamon, black pepper and toffee weave within the waves of ripeness.",91
Virginie Boone,Spell 2014 Umino Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"The vineyard source for this tasty wine is farmed by a fifth-generation Japanese-American originally from California's Central Valley. Tightly wound in oak and tannin, it opens pleasantly to reveal a wealth of rose petals, earth and youthful ripe, dark cherry. With moderate acidity and body, it lingers on the palate.",91
Anne Krebiehl MW,Gruber Röschitz 2015 Trockenbeerenauslese Chardonnay (Niederösterreich),"The nose is uncertain and hovers between musky botrytis and lactic tartness. The palate removes all doubt and shines with luscious, concentrated sweetness, referencing the pleasant bitterness of honeycomb and the spice of maple syrup. Pure lemon freshness illuminates everything. Drink now through 2025.",91
Joe Czerwinski,Henry's Drive Vignerons 2013 Pillar Box Shiraz (Padthaway),"A solid value, the 2013 Pillar Box offers oodles of blackberry and plum fruit, framed by vanilla and accented by mocha. It's creamy-velvety in texture, with a rich long finish. Drink now through 2025.",91

Matt Kettmann,Joseph Carr 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"Deep and lush aromas of candied blueberry and black cherry meet with chocolate cake, light brown spices and a touch of beef jerky on the nose of this judiciously priced wine. Though a tad light on the palate at first, it has an energetic and spicy acidity that carries forth flavors of tobacco and black fruit.",91
Kerin O’Keefe,La Prevostura 2012  Lessona,"Enticingly fragrant, this offers alluring scents of rose, perfumed berry, chopped mint, menthol and cake spice. The elegant palate delivers tart red cherry, aromatic herb and star anise alongside fine-grained tannins and bright acidity. A mineral note signals the close. Give this time to fully develop. Drink 2019–2032.",91
Roger Voss,Lallier NV R.012 Brut  (Champagne),"Although this is a nonvintage wine, it is a blend around 2012, hence the number in the name. Dominated by Pinot Noir, this ripe, full-bodied wine has a tangy texture boosted by acidity that contrasts with rich red apple and crisp pear flavors that give richness. Drink now.",91
Kerin O’Keefe,Le Marchesine 2007 Secolo Novo Giovanni Biatta Metodo Classico Chardonnay (Franciacorta),"Aromas of orchard fruit, dried herb and toasted bread crust lead the nose.

Anne Krebiehl MW,Domaine Zinck NV Brut Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace),"Notes of ripe yellow apple play enticingly on the nose.

The bubbles are creamy and disperse the lovely flavors to great effect. This is classy and delicious.",91
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Dr. Heidemanns-Bergweiler 2015 Dry Mineral Riesling (Mosel),"Whiffs of candlestick and honeycomb lend subtlety to zesty white-grapefruit and honeydew flavors in this dry Riesling.

Michael Schachner,Ferrer Bobet 2012 Vieilles Velles Red (Priorat),"This version of old-vines Carignan-Garnacha is heavily toasted to the point of smelling charred, with coffee and cured-beef notes. Big and blocky on the palate, reflecting a warm year, this tastes toasty, with flavors of wild herbs, baking spices, char and black fruits in the background. Licorice notes and a final blast of char control the finish. Drink through 2021.",91
Michael Schachner,Granbazán 2015 Etiqueta Ámbar Albariño (Rías Baixas),"Dry, dusty, elegant peach and minerally notes open this excellent Albariño.

Drink through 2022.",91
,Krupp Brothers 2009 Stagecoach Vineyard Synchrony Red (Napa Valley),"This is rich and dense in blackberry and cherry jam, currant, mocha, anise and smoky cedar flavors. The mountain tannins are strong but refined, and the finish is long and spicy. It's a Bordeaux blend based on Cabernet Sauvignon, but be forewarned: It's high in alcohol.",93
Paul Gregutt,Pamplin 2009 Proprietary Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Pamplin's admirable focus on its pair of Bordeaux-style blends is rather rare. This is the more expensive of the two, and a fine, fat, forward bottling in this warm vintage. It's three-quarters Cabernet Sauvignon, with lovely fruit that's compact upon opening, fleshing out with air time. Clean, dense and focused, it is bright with berry and cassis flavors, plus subtle barrel notes.",93
Paul Gregutt,Pepper Bridge 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"A rich mix of red, blue and black fruit opens into a sappy, spicy midpalate. The lush fruits are highlighted by a wash of milk chocolate. At first tightly wound, the wine seems to show more oak flavors with air, hinting at licorice and Bourbon barrel.",93
Paul Gregutt,Forgeron 2009 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A hint of mint can be detected in the opening aromas of this Merlot, which includes a splash of Cabernet Franc in the blend.

,Sterling 2009 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Just beautiful, this is the best Sterling Reserve Cabernet in years, and a huge improvement over the 2008.

Lauren Buzzeo,Domaine Cazes 1996 Ambré Grenache Blanc (Rivesaltes),"This is a lush and satisfying Rivesaltes Ambré, made from 100% White Grenache and aged in oak for seven years. There's a gorgeous rancio quality to the wine with notes of almond and orange rind throughout, framed by aromas and flavors of quince paste, wood-grilled peach, fruit cake and carmelized date. The long finish shows good evolution, transitioning from notes of stone fruit to peach pit and finally ending on a sweet spice accent.",93
,Capannelle 2007 Riserva  (Chianti Classico),"A beautiful expression of Sangiovese, this shows delicate and elegant characteristics of wild berry and light spice. The finish is silky and crisp, and the wine would stand up nicely to breaded veal or roast chicken.",92
Michael Schachner,Pictor 2008  Toro,"Deeply layered and pure on the nose, with tar, cola and toasty oak aromas, this feels deep, full and choppy, with tough tannins and seriously dark flavors of blackened spice, berry and bitter chocolate.

Paul Gregutt,Amavi 2010 Les Collines Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This is pure single-vineyard Syrah, dark and tasting of cassis and blackberry, with a slightly briny, oyster-shell undercurrent. As it breathes, it displays a cured meat flavor, with a lively, citrusy finish accented by espresso.",92
Roger Voss,André Blanck et ses Fils 2010 Schlossberg Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"Showing as much freshness and acidity as the hallmark spice of a Gewürztraminer, this is a white-fruit-dominant wine, poised and elegant, with a touch of minerality. Keep for 2–3 years.",92
,Castello di Querceto 2008 Il Querciolaia Red (Colli della Toscana Centrale),"This blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon opens with impressive intensity, with notes of bold cherry, crushed black pepper, clove, dried currant and tobacco. The mouthfeel is velvety and rich, with a touch of bright acidity on the finish.",92
Roger Voss,Charles Ellner 2002 Millésime Brut  (Champagne),"This retains so much freshness, with just a hint of toast showing at the back of a wine that otherwise projects minerality, a tight structure and intense citrus acidity. It should be aged for several more years.",92
Roger Voss,Scheiblhofer 2010 Andau Zweigelt (Burgenland),"This is a powerful, wood-aged wine. It's still showing its toast at the moment, but expect the wine to round out, yielding solid tannins and a concentrated black-plum flavor. With a rich yet firm finish, this should age well over several years.",92
Paul Gregutt,Spring Valley Vineyard 2009 Uriah Estate Grown Red Wine Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This Merlot-dominated blend features juicy berry flavors and tart, citrusy acids. It has gentle details of pepper, herb, lemon verbena and orange peel. It's a pleasure to see more elegant complexity in these latest Spring Valley reds.",92
Roger Voss,Jean-Marc Bernhard 2010 Furstentum Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace),"This ripe, full, almost toasty wine tastes of tropical fruit and spice, giving it an exotic feel. At the same time, the right amount of acidity acts as a fine balance. This concentrated wine, medium-sweet in style, should be aged for 2–3 years.",92
,MacPhail 2010 Gap's Crown Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Fans of ripe, sweet fruit will love this Pinot. It's huge in juicy raspberry and cherry, with spicy hints of Dr. Pepper and red licorice. It will be fun to see how the wine evolves over the next 6–8 years.",92
Michael Schachner,Matarromera 2006 Reserva  (Ribera del Duero),"Tight, dark and oaky on the nose, this has woody power, cedary complexity and lots of staunch berry character. It is full, grabby and tannic, showing a firm spine to support toasty, oaky, clove-influenced flavors. Dark, tight and toasty on the finish; drink now–2019.",92
Paul Gregutt,Nefarious 2010 Rx-3 Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"“Rhône times three” seems to be the code name for this classy blend of Grenache, Mourvèdre and Syrah. It takes the best from each grape, creating a rich, pure, high-acid wine with a zingy berry flavor, plus a mineral underpinning and earthy, coffee-soaked tannins.",92
Paul Gregutt,DeLille 2011 Chaleur Estate Blanc Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Styled after the great white wines of Bordeaux, this is fresh and clean, with luscious mixed fruit flavors that emphasize apple and melon. A cooler vintage has produced a wine of low alcohol and real finesse, with a light dusting of toasty oak. Given its impeccable balance, it could be cellared for another 6–8 years.",92
Paul Gregutt,Doyenne 2009 Aix Red (Red Mountain),"A blend of 58% Syrah, 38% Cabernet Sauvignon and 4% Mourvèdre, this combinins power with a big yum factor. Potent and rich, with woody, spicy highlights, the juicy fruit flavors favor blackberry and black cherry. A whiff of smoke runs through the finish.",92
Roger Voss,Dürnberg 2011 Rabenstein Grüner Veltliner (Weinviertel),"The chalk soil of the Rabenstein Vineyard has 50-year-old vines, which produce a dense, concentrated wine. Spice and mineral characters combine with creamed apple in a rich display. The wine could certainly age over the next 3–4 years. Screwcap.",92
Paul Gregutt,Forgeron 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Beautifully aromatic, this purple-hued wine offers generous plum and black cherry flavors that are cloaked in mocha, with muscular, earthy tannins. It spent over two years in barrel (half new oak), and will benefit from a bit more bottle age for all of its rich flavors to fully integrate.",92
Michael Schachner,Alidis 2009 VS  (Ribera del Duero),"Cola, coconut and ripe blackberry aromas are draped all over the wine's bouquet. On the palate, it's a bit choppy and acidic, with pounding flavors of black cherry, blackberry and leather. Juicy, zesty and jagged feeling at the moment, this should be consumed no earlier than 2014 and may be at its best around 2018.",92
,Turley 2010 Library Vineyard Petite Sirah (Napa Valley),"This is so chocolaty and rich, it's impossible to resist a second or third glass. Although it's heady in alcohol, there's an excellent burst of acidity, and the texture is pure velvet. The blackberry tart, orange zest, spice and sandalwood flavors change continuously as the wine warms in the glass.",92
,Turley 2010 Pesenti Vineyard Petite Sirah (Paso Robles),"This is classically proportioned in the warm-climate style. It provides a textbook example of the variety's inky black and purple color, rich, thick tannins and elaborate flavors. These flavors include profoundly ripe summer blackberry and mulberry, smoky, umami-rich bacon and sweet sandalwood. Full-bodied and dry, this is a wine to warm the blood on cold winter nights.",92
,Whitehall Lane 2009 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Very opulent and jammy in blackberry, cherry and mocha flavors, this has a strong oak presence in the form of caramelized wood. It defines Napa richness, but it is too tannic and immature to properly enjoy now. Give it a snooze for 6–8 years.",92
Roger Voss,Coteaux da Murta 2013 Quinta da Murta Arinto (Bucelas),"This mature wine, has lost youthful fruitiness and gained a more nutty, smooth and rich quality. There are touches of toastiness and almonds, with an aromatic aftertaste. Drink now.",88
Michael Schachner,Fillaboa 2015 Estate Grown/Viñedo Propio Albariño (Rías Baixas),"Fleshy oily aromas of orange peel and white flowers lead to a chunky, citric palate that's more full and blocky than elegant. Briny orange and tart nectarine flavors finish plump.",88

Kerin O’Keefe,Jasci & Marchesani 2013 Rudhir  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo),"Violet, plum, black cherry and cooking spice aromas take center stage on this enjoyable red. The juicy tangy palate doles out blackberry, raspberry, white pepper and a hint of cinnamon framed in chewy tannins.",88

Sean P. Sullivan,Kestrel 2012 Falcon Series Merlot (Yakima Valley),"Aromas of raspberry and herb intermingle on the nose, which also shows a touch of reduction. The palate offers soft tart fruit flavors that provide appeal.",88
Kerin O’Keefe,La Valentina 2012 Spelt Riserva  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo),"Aromas of truffle, spiced blackberry, violet and a whiff dark spice come together on this. The chewy medium-bodied palate offers black cherry, plum and clove framed in fine-grained tannins.",88
Roger Voss,Lavradores de Feitoria 2014 Très Bagos Reserva Red (Douro),"This is a fruity, juicy wine with wood and bright red fruits in equal balance. The entry-level wine made by a grouping of 19 growers, it has concentration along with minerality and acidity. It needs to age further, so drink from 2018.",88
Roger Voss,Manzwine 2014 Penedo do Lexim Red (Lisboa),"Named after a local volcanic rock formation, this wine is a delicious blend of Aragonez (aka Tempranillo) and Touriga Nacional. It is rich and smooth with black fruits, soft tannins and an aftertaste that is lively with acidity. The wine is ready to drink.",88
Michael Schachner,Mas Pere NV Rosado Sparkling (Cava),"This salmon-colored rosé is made from the Trepat grape. It smells common, with yeasty bready notes of orange peel and orange blossom. A basic palate is balanced, while this tastes of leesy dried melon prior to a medium-long finish.",88
Sean P. Sullivan,Milbrandt 2015 Traditions Evergreen Vineyard Riesling (Ancient Lakes),"Aromas of mineral, flowers and freshly cut green apple are followed by a just off-dry, lightly spritzy palate full of stone-fruit flavors.",88
Jim Gordon,Monte Volpe 2013 Sangiovese (Mendocino County),"Light spicy, earthy aromas, tart raspberry and cranberry flavors and a firmly tannic texure add up to a well-structured and rather lean-tasting wine. It makes a good accompaniment to food.",88

Roger Voss,Pascal Aufranc 2015 En Rémont Vignes de 1939  (Chénas),"This three-acre parcel has produced a beautiful fruity wine. With red cherry and spice flavors, the wine is perfumed and juicy. Crisp acidity shoots through the attractive fruit to give a wine that is only lightly tannic and ready to drink.",88
Michael Schachner,Ricominciare 2010 Altísimo Malbec (Mendoza),"Cherry, cassis and root beer aromas are appealing. In the mouth, this is wall-to-wall rough due to fierce tannins. Baked berry flavors are blocky and simmer away on a rugged finish.",88
Roger Voss,Robert Perroud 2015 L'Enfer des Balloquets  (Brouilly),"Named after the steeply sloping vineyard, the wine is cool, crisp with tight cherry flavors. It is lined with acidity and some tannins. The wine will need another few months to soften out and become richer.",88
Sean P. Sullivan,Rôtie Cellars 2015 Grenache Blanc (Washington),"This is an up-and-coming variety for the state. High-toned aromas of lime leaf and citrus are followed by a lean, almost faint but still but well-balanced palate with a thread of acidity running through it. Pair it with food to see it at its best.",88
Matt Kettmann,San Simeon 2015 Stefano Vineyard Viognier (Paso Robles),"Warm yellow apple, light custard and white peach combine for a creamy nose on this bottling from the Riboli family's new estate vineyard.

Anna Lee C. Iijima,Pflüger 2014 Dürkheimer Trocken Pinot Noir (Pfalz),"Dark shades of smoked nuts, char and dried, savory herbs mingle amidst ruddy black cherry and cranberry flavors in this bold, intensely structured Pinot Noir. It's a big, richly textured wine enveloping the palate in folds of dense black fruit. Fine but slightly bitter tannins mark the finish.",88
Virginie Boone,Picket Fence 2014 Top Rail Red (Sonoma County),"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Malbec is a steal, offering a robust touch of char on the front end aromatically before unleashing bright red fruit and soft tannin. Ultimately light bodied, it retains just the right amount of grippy tannin to give it some bite.",88
Paul Gregutt,South Stage 2012 Grenache (Rogue Valley),"This powerful wine puts purple plum and tart cherry fruit front and center. That fruit drives the bus through a dense palate, with a burst of acidity adding a turbo charge. It saw 25% new French oak.",88
Virginie Boone,Taken Wine Co. 2014 Taken Red (Napa Valley),"This perfumed expression of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Merlot shows a great depth of complexity and deliciousness for the price. Firm, grippy tannin stars alongside dark cherry, currant, clove and tobacco, all along a softened layering of texture.",88

Michael Schachner,Viña Cobos 2015 Felino Malbec (Mendoza),"Earthy black-fruit aromas set up a rubbery, heavy palate with plenty of oak and related resin.

Roger Voss,Yohan Lardy 2015 Les Michelons  (Moulin-à-Vent),"The wine is still young with its crisp red fruits and tense tannins. It is a structured wine, firm with a dry core and still developing its fruitiness. It will need to age a while yet, so drink from 2018.",88
Sean P. Sullivan,Analemma 2014 Atavus Vineyard Gewürztraminer (Columbia Gorge (WA)),"The aromas are light, with notes of freshly cut apple and spice. It drinks dry with elegantly styled fruit flavors that linger on the finish. It shows a very pretty styling.",88
Paul Gregutt,Argyle 2014 Nuthouse Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"Light strawberry fruit with tart acidity carries a wine of modest proportions. It's drinking well, and might be a good choice for a simple salmon preparation, as it would not overwhelm the fish. The finishing tannins have a definite herbal flavor.",88
,Flora Springs 2008 Hillside Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"A wonderfully smooth, dry, complex young Cabernet, and yes, the tannins have that famous Rutherford dust. The wine is the opposite of a fruit bomb, with moderate alcohol and interesting flavors of herbs, cherries, blackberries and spicy sandalwood. As good as it is now, it should ride out the next 8–10 years.",95
,Hirsch 2007 San Andreas Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Young and tart in cool-climate acidity, this Pinot needs time in the cellar. It's an exotic wine, spicy and peppery, almost briary, like a Zinfandel, except with flavors of wild forest raspberries, cherries, orange zest and a hint of pine cone. It's as cellarable a Pinot Noir as exists in California. Best after 2015.",95
Roger Voss,Joseph Drouhin 2008  Charmes-Chambertin,"Structured, concentrated, a wine that shows power from both fruit and tannins. The opulent strawberry flavors are paralleled by firm, dry tannins. As the combination comes together, this will become a glorious wine.",95
Paul Gregutt,DeLille 2009 Chaleur Estate Blanc White (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Consistent year after year, this blend of 67% Sauvignon Blanc and 33% Sémillon is modeled after top-flight white Bordeaux.

Riveting, delicious  and unique.",95
,Benanti 2006 Serra della Contessa Red (Sicilia),"A stellar, superb wine that embodies all the grace, power and charm of the Mount Etna volcano in Sicily. This highly unique and distinctive territory has shaped an elegant expression of Nerello Mascalese (with 20% Nerello Cappuccio) offering aromas of wild berry set against delicately toasted pistachio nut. In the mouth, the wine is silky, compact and very persistent.",94
Paul Gregutt,Maison Bleue 2009 Soleil Roussanne (Yakima Valley),"Another stellar effort from this terrific new winery.

A tour de force.",94
,Pax 2007 Kobler Family Vineyard Syrah (Green Valley),"Awesome. A superior California Syrah, one of the finest of the vintage.

Just delicious now, and should hold in the bottle over the next six years.",94
Roger Voss,Chanson Père et Fils 2008  Charmes-Chambertin,"Big, full-bodied wine, the great tannins dominating the underlying red fruit. It's firmly concentrated, intense, a powerhouse of dense texture and obviously a wine that will need aging. Give it 5–6 years.",94
Roger Voss,Chanson Père et Fils 2008  Clos de Vougeot,"Very dense wine, its tannins solid and concentrated. The structure is the leader here, with the young fruit showing through as black plum skins and crushed strawberries. This is a firmly tannic wine, needing aging.",94
Virginie Boone,Domaine de la Terre Rouge 2008 Ascent Syrah (Sierra Foothills),"A super-structured, incredibly textured Syrah from the Sierra Foothills, this is Bill Easton's best of the best lots, aptly named Ascent, that he puts out every year to showcase his deft handling of age-worthy Syrah. This one will continue to develop its earthy, dusty, bacon fat and cigar box qualities over time. A truly beautiful bottle of wine.",94
Roger Voss,Domaine Leflaive 2008 Clavoillon Premier Cru  (Puligny-Montrachet),"Beautiful lemon-scented wine, balancing rich butter and apricot flavors with intense, pure acidity. The wine at this stage is toast and fruit, still coalescing into its long-term future.",94
Roger Voss,Joseph Drouhin 2008 Clos des Mouches Premier Cru  (Beaune),"The aromas of smoky new wood follow through to the wood flavors on the palate. However, it's the powerful sweet black cherry and red berry fruit flavors, layered with fruit tannins and acidity, that are driving this impressive wine. For aging at least six years.",94
,Tyler 2008 Clos Pepe Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Lots of toasty oak on this Pinot, but also plenty of rich, unctuous fruit to support it.

An impressive introductory wine from Trefethen, off the estate vineyard.",94
,Trefethen 2008 Dragon's Tooth Red Wine Red (Napa Valley),"This vintage the wine is comprised of Malbec, Cabernet and Petit Verdot. It's a deeper, darker, richer wine than the '07, with which it was co-released, and equally high-scoring. Almost sweetly jammy in black cherries, raspberries, cola and caramelized oak, it's rescued by firm tannins and a finish that dries it out in minerals and spices. Now–2016.",94
Paul Gregutt,Alexandria Nicole 2008 Destiny Ridge Vineyard Destiny Red Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"Supple, dark, and laced with licorice, cassis, and clove, this well-crafted Bordeaux blend does not scream high alcohol, though it tops 14.6%. What keeps it focused and precise are the vivid acids and sculpted tannins. It's the work of a young winemaker who is improving dramatically with each new vintage, even as his vineyard puts out better and better fruit.",94
Virginie Boone,Lineage 2007 Red (Livermore Valley),"Though it's a huge tannic monster right now, this Bordeaux blend, a first release and new brand name from Steven Kent Winery, is an ode to Steven Kent Mirassou's family's long lineage in California winemaking and the roots of Livermore's history in wine as well. A majority Cabernet (75%), with all the lush cassis and black cherry one would hope for, the wine shows nicely honed herbal notes from its 15% Cab Franc in the middle, with a little touch of spice on the finish coming from 5% Petit Verdot (3% Malbec and 2% Merlot round out the blend). Give this one time and it will surely reward.",94
Paul Gregutt,Buty 2009 Merlot-Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Wide open and seductive, this brings together grapes from both Conner Lee (northern Columbia Basin) and Champoux (Horse Heaven Hills). Muscular, ripe and round, the sweet blackberry and cassis fruit is limned with a granite-like minerality. Great concentration and layering—a berry/rock/tannin layer cake.",94
Paul Gregutt,McCrea 2006 Boushey Grande Côte Vineyard Syrah (Yakima Valley),"This particular bottling belongs with the very best Syrahs from this Syrah-infatuated state. A broad, toasty, full-bodied and fully realized wine, it has begun to smooth out from the extra years in bottle, but has a long life ahead. Berries, cherries, chocolate, coffee, mocha, tobacco, fungus, graphite… the flavors go and go.",94
Joe Czerwinski,Torbreck 2007 Descendant Shiraz-Viognier (Barossa Valley),"Full bodied and concentrated without being overly heavy or tannic, this is a stunning blend of Shiraz (92%) and Viognier (8%). Hints of roasted or grilled meat and black olive balance the bold blackberry fruit, leaving behind a lingering finish of warmth and dusty cocoa. Drink now–2020.",94
,Beringer 2008 Alluvium Blanc Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon (Knights Valley),"As always, Beringer's Alluvium blend is a complex white wine, meant to pair with good food. The '08 is comprised of Sauvignon Blanc, Sémillon, Chardonnay and Viognier. It's fruity, crisp and dry.",88
,Corte Sant' Alda 2007 Campi Magri  (Valpolicella Superiore),Campo Magri is a bright and lively Valpolicella Superiore with crisp tones of cherry and wild berry backed by slight smoke and spice. The natural acidity will cut through the density or ossobuco or beef stew.,88
,Corteforte 2007 Podere Bertarole  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso),"This vineyard-designate Ripasso opens with dark concentration and lush aromas of mature fruit, spice, leather, chocolate and dried beef or cured ham. This is a rich and velvety wine that could stand up to barbecued short ribs smothered in spicy sauce.",88
,Fabiano 2008  Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso,"Fabiano's newest Ripasso opens with bright cherry aromas followed by spice, clove, black pepper and pressed rose petal. The wine boasts a soft, steady feel in the mouth and relatively smooth texture overall.",88
,Gamba 2007 Le Quare  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso),"Instead of brawn and muscle, this ruby Ripasso offers elegance and finesse. The nose is redolent of polished black stone, Indian spice and loads of dried cassis and wild berry. There's a playful hint of sweet almond and cinnamon at the end.",88
Paul Gregutt,Hogue 2009 Pinot Grigio (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Another fine effort in a continuing series of outstanding PGs from Hogue. This is tart and stylish, loaded with citrus and bracingly acidic. Flavors meld lemon, lime, lemon verbena, orange peel and a slice of pear.",88
,Bell 2007 Claret Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A little on the soft side, but very dry, with smoky oak and blackberry fruit dominating. Feels good and chewy and rich, with interesting herb and spice notes. Will age for a few years, but not for a long time. Give it a good decant.",88
,Brigaldara 2007 Il Vegro  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso),Ripasso Il Vegro offers a rich and meaty bouquet with aromas of cured beef and honey roasted ham. There are also bright fruit tones of cherry and blackberry and the wine adds a crisp touch of sour cranberry at the very end.,88
Paul Gregutt,Cadence 2008 Coda Red (Red Mountain),"Tapteil, Ciel and Cara Mia vineyard fruit, a blend of 35% Cabernet Sauvignon, 31% Merlot, 28% Cab Franc and 6% Petit Verdot. Young and tight, with the characteristic Cadence chalk and stone undertone. The fruit is pretty strawberry, with a peppery herbal streak, good length and fine balance.",88
,Latium di Morini 2005 Campo Leòn  (Amarone della Valpolicella),"Campo Leòn is a jammy, chewy wine with raw notes of black cherry, Indian spice, cedar wood and melted chocolate. It's thick, syrupy and it's hard to imagine a balanced food pairing outside succulent red meat.",88
,Luigi Righetti 2006 Capitel de' Roari  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),"This is a smooth and rich Amarone with equal parts jammy fruit set against a smokey oak component. The wine slides nicely over the palate with a lavish, velvety texture and imparts more oak spice and mesquite on the close.",88
Joe Czerwinski,Marquee 2008 Signature Chardonnay (Yarra Valley),"A lively, balanced wine at an accessible price point, Marquee's 2008 Signature Chard boasts aromas of smoke, vanilla and stone fruit and flavors that follow along similar lines, with white peach and pineapple coming to the fore. Drink now–2012.",88
Michael Schachner,Miguel Torres 2007 Manso de Velasco Viejas Viñas Old Vines Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Valley),"A bit mulchy and swampy for Manso, with earthy tobacco and generic berry fruit aromas. The palate is flush and a little heavy, with creamy flavors of vanilla, dill weed and cassis. Soft and sweet late, with chunkiness and a medium to basic structure. A very good wine but not great as in past years.",88
Roger Voss,Mittnacht Frères 2009 Terre d'Etoiles Pinot Blanc (Alsace),"Classic, soft, easy and broad Pinot Blanc. There is an attractive buttery character to go with the peach and lime flavors. The wine is ripe, with pure fruit and a final tang of acidity.",88
,Monte del Frá 2005 Tenuta Lena di Mezzo  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),"This is a powerful but not exaggerated style of Amarone that delivers ripe cherry and blackberry aromas followed by new leather, cigar box, spice and rum cake. It imparts a very smooth, rich and supple feel.",88
,Montresor 2006 Giacomo Montresor  (Amarone della Valpolicella),"A 70-30 blend of Corvina and Rondinella, this bright Amarone offers simple but genuine aromas of forest berry, toasted almond, cherry cola and vanilla bean. The wine is smooth, polished and crisp on the close.",88
,Musella 2005 Riserva  (Amarone della Valpolicella),"This Riserva Amarone shows a meaty, bold, sweet and jammy personality with loads of aromatic intensity. It's almost too much of a good thing with overripe flavors of prune and berry marmalade.",88
Michael Schachner,Paso a Paso 2009 Verdejo (La Mancha),"The best Paso a Paso white yet; it's ripe and smells of pineapple and melon, while the palate is pure and has a solid feel. Flavors of apple, peach and pithy citrus are honest, and the finish is clean. Delivers what it should and more.",88
Joe Czerwinski,Penfolds 2007 Bin 128 Shiraz (Coonawarra),"From a cooler region than its Bin 28 stablemate, Penfolds' 2007 Bin 128 is a medium-bodied Shiraz that features touches of peppery spice, raspberry-cherry fruit and a darker edge of chocolate and coffee. The tannins are supple without being soft, giving this a drinking window that should extend through 2017 or so.",88
,Qupé 2008 Purisima Mountain Vineyard Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),"A beautiful Syrah. It's very dry and softly tannic, with complex blackberry, black cherry, cola and sandalwood flavors. Could be firmer in structure, but a lovely wine to drink now.",88
,Ridge 2007 California Monte Bello Red (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Not the best Monte Bello to emerge in recent years. There's a sharpness of acidity that cuts the palate, and it accentuates the fresh fruit, giving it a jammy zing. More troubling is an overripe raisiny flavor. This bottling is, of course, one of the most ageable in California, but the inherent imbalance seems to mitigate against long time in the cellar.",88
Michael Schachner,Santa Ema 2007 Catalina Red (Peumo),"Smoky, rubbery and sweet on the nose, with mocha and caramel shadings. The palate, however, is more tight and narrow; the feel is fresh and blazing, while the flavors are piercing and suggest red fruits like cranberry and cherry. Citric but with just enough weight to register as true Cabernet (with 18% Carmenère and 7% Cab Franc).",88
,Cono Sur 2008 20 Barrels Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley),"Bold and spicy, with a lot of cinnamon, licorice and toasty aromas. Quite intense in the mouth, where black cherry, toast and vanilla flavors lead the charge. The finish is tangy and long, with coffee and citrus accents coming along late in the game. Made from whole berries fermented in open-top vats.",88
,Cono Sur 2009 Visión Viognier (Colchagua Valley),"An interesting and unsual wine for Chile. Hailing from grafted vines originally planted to Chenin Blanc in 1956, this Viognier is superfloral, with oily aromas along with apple blossom, nectarine and apricot. The palate has nice natural acidity and sweet flavors of melon, mango and citrus. A little big and unfocused and sweet, but still intriguing and nicely made.",88
,Corte San Benedetto 2003  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,"Corte San Benedetto is a small, family run winery and its 2003 Amarone shows ripe notes of black cherry, mesquite, blackberry and soft vanilla. The oak element is evident here; the wine is soft and supple on the close.",88
,Domìni Veneti 2006 Verjago  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore),"Loads of aromatic intensity comes through on the bouquet with lovely layers of ripe cherry, spice, mesquite wood, Indian spice and cola. The oak element is evident here and will integrate with a bit more time in the bottle. In the mouth, this rich, ruby-colored wine offers jammy fruit and soft, velvety texture.",88
Roger Voss,Dopff & Irion NV Cuvée Prestige Brut Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace),"A mature, serious wine, showing toasty flavors that are rounding out the fruit. A definite food wine, its richness tempered with a bite of acidity and delicious final crispness.",88
,Falezza 2005  Amarone della Valpolicella,"Here's a new producer from Valpolicella who presents a sharp and angular Amarone with fine aromas of spice, wild berry, black tobacco and tea leaf. The wine is bright and compact with soft tannins and natural freshness.",88
Roger Voss,Rieflé 2006 Pinot Gris Bonheur Convivial Pinot Gris (Alsace),"Rich and spicy, this is a fine, dry, peppery Pinot Gris. In the mouth there's weight and ripeness, as well as some fat, yellow fruits. There's a touch of lychee as well, giving an exotic edge to the finish.",88
Michael Schachner,Casa Silva 2005 Microterroir de los Lingues Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),"A lot of olive and herbs upfront, with cumin and other exotic, arguably unusual aromas. The palate is soft and a little low on structure, but the flavors are big and sweet, almost overripe and syrupy. There's cola, blackberry, coffee and mulchy herbal flavors from start to finish. A big wine that needs to be drunk now; it's not going to get better.",88
Roger Voss,Château Lamothe-Vincent 2011 Le Grand Rossignol du Château Lamothe Vincent  (Bordeaux Supérieur),"With light toast aromas, this is a wine that shows vanilla from wood aging more than its fruitiness. There is a barnyard edge to it that brings out rusticity. On the finish, acidity does bring some freshness.",84
Roger Voss,Château Pey la Tour 2011  Bordeaux,"Structure keeps this firm, dry wine solidly closed. It is tightly wound at this stage, only hinting at a brighter, fruity future. Drink after 2015.",84
,Clayhouse 2011 Red Cedar Vineyard Estate Syrah-Petite Sirah (Paso Robles),"Sweet oak and rich cherry jam combine to make this blend distinctly candied in nature. It's a straightforward, simple with smooth tannins.",84
,Dilecta 2011 The Tiller Caliza Vineyard Russell Family Vineyards Grenache-Syrah (Paso Robles),"This wine is mostly Grenache, with about one-third Syrah blended in. There are pleasant cherry and blackberry flavors on the palate, but also a mushroomy streak that distracts. It's not likely to improve with age so drink up.",84
,Grayson 2012 Lot 10 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"Harsh in mouthfeel, this Cab has cherry, black currant and wintergreen mint flavors, wrapped into firm but fine tannins. For the price, it's not bad for everyday fare.",84
,Vinemark 2011 Pinot Noir (Napa Valley),"This is a candied Pinot with flavors of pink bubblegum, raspberries and strawberries. Give it some time in the glass and drink up.",84
Paul Gregutt,Wetzel Estate 2010 Estate Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"The fruit flavors never get past light, tart cranberry in this wine, and there is an earthy tinge that runs through the palate and into the finish. It's thin and tannic in style.",84
,Magnolia Court 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Coast),"This rustic Cabernet has pretty good varietal flavors of blackberries and dried currants, enhanced with an oaky sweetness. It's full bodied and tannic, and fine for drinking now.",84
,Picket Fence 2012 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This value Pinot Noir is perfectly fine for everyday drinking, with a light, silky texture framing raspberry and oak flavors.",84
Michael Schachner,Recuerdo 2011 Malbec (Uco Valley),"Recuerdo is the house brand from the Vines of Mendoza project, which is relying on young Tupungato vineyards that expand annually. This vintage shows floral berry aromas along with Middle East spice notes of cumin and curry. In the mouth, it's sharp and hollow, like an elevator that skips floors. Clipped flavors of boysenberry are acidic, while the finish lacks substance.",84
Kerin O’Keefe,Adanti 2009  Montefalco Rosso,"Made with Sangiovese, Sagrantino, Barbera, Merlot and Cabernet, this wine opens with dominant oak aromas that carry through to the palate alongside subdued notes of prune and fig. It lacks fruit richness and freshness to support the oak.",84
Roger Voss,Château Haut Nadeau 2011 Réserve du Propriétaire  (Bordeaux Supérieur),"This wine has a lean side that takes away from the bright acidity and fruitiness. With its berry fruit flavors, it should be rich, but lacks a middle.",84
Virginie Boone,un4seen 2011 Chardonnay (Lodi),"A strong pineapple and mango imprint persists throughout this Chardonnay, along with bright acidity and a floral finish.",84
,Vinemark 2010 Touriga Nacional (Paso Robles),"Made from one of Port's best grapes, this wine is sweet and simple. It has sugary raspberry and vanilla flavors, with a sting of heat from high alcohol.",84
Paul Gregutt,Wetzel Estate 2011 Estate Pinot Blanc (Willamette Valley),"A scent of fusel oil mixes into this lightly fruity wine, along with citrus rind and hints of almond.",84
Sean P. Sullivan,Del Rio 2010 Claret (Rogue Valley),"Coming from the cool 2010 vintage, this blend of half Merlot along with four other Bordeaux grape varieties brings notes of toast, bittersweet chocolate, citrus and cranberry. It's tart and puckering with tightly wound tannins that need time to resolve.",84
,Grayson 2012 Pinot Noir (California),"This isn't the most complicated Pinot Noir, but it is a clean, easy-drinking wine. With raspberry and cherry flavors wrapped into a silky texture, it will be fine to drink with burgers.",84
,Guenoc 2012 Chardonnay (California),"With sweet oak, buttered toast, vanilla, pineapple and mango flavors, this is an easy Chardonnay to drink now. The price is good for a Chard this rich and creamy.",84
,Vinemark 2009 Primitivo (Paso Robles),"This wine is medium bodied with spicy, brambly wild berry and tobacco flavors, as well as heady alcohol. It shows some unbalanced green notes. Drink now.",83
,Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi 2012 Zinfandel (California),"At this price, and with a case production of 110,000, lots of Americans will consider themselves lucky to have a solid red wine like this. It's not terribly complicated, but offers easy flavors of cherries and oak.",83
Roger Voss,Barton & Guestier NV Partager Red,"Soft, fruity and juicy, this is a pleasant, simple wine that is a blend from different European countries. It is balanced and very drinkable for parties or barbecues. Screwcap.",83
Michael Schachner,Bodegas Tobía 2012 Viña Tobía White (Rioja),"Peach and apple aromas are modest. The palate is juicy and citric in feel, while flavors of melon, apple and nectarine finish tangy, with a citrusy taste.",83
Roger Voss,Univitis 2012 Grand Théatre  (Bordeaux Blanc),"Light, bright and fruity, this wine is full of citrus acidity and a ripe, herbaceous character. Lively and fresh, it is a Sauvignon-dominated wine.",83
Roger Voss,Château Gréteau Médeville 2011  Bordeaux Supérieur,"This wine seems thin and rather tight. It has as much acidity as it does fruit, and a dry tannic structure. Not a wine for aging.",83
Joe Czerwinski,Wildberry Estate 2005 Shiraz (Margaret River),"Full-bodied and firm, this dark-fruited Shiraz an be consumed now with rare beef or lamb, or cellared 2–3 years. Cola and blackberry fruit dominate, with notes of chocolate and cedar chiming in on the finish.",89
Michael Schachner,Salentein 2005 Reserve Malbec (Uco Valley),"Earthy, deep and true to its Uco Valley roots; this is a very good and fairly serious Malbec that doesn't try to overstep its natural limitations. It's not too extracted or oaky but instead delivers robust blackberry, plum and caramel flavors backed by a warm, mildly oaky finish with menthol and mocha. Drink now into 2010.",89
Roger Voss,Sattlerhof 2006 Steirische Klassik Sauvignon Blanc (Südsteiermark),"This is beautiful, herbaceous Sauvigon Blanc, the signature grape of Styria, in a fine, ripe version, all rich fruits, green apple juice, fresh berries and lively acidity. Glass stopper.",89
Roger Voss,Steininger 2006 Brut Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),"A ripe, fragrant wine that also manages to retain fine crispness. There is some Grüner pepper and spice, but the freshness of the wine allows it to show grapefruit and other citrus characters as well as tense acidity.",89
Roger Voss,Summerer 2007 Steinhaus Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),"Fresh but rich, this young wine has structured edges, great purity of green currant fruits as well as fine concentration. The roundness of the palate is matched by its delicious acidity. Glass stopper.",89
,Robert Stemmler 2005 Ferguson Block Pinot Noir (Carneros),"The flavors of this Pinot, made from pre-Dijon clone Martini selection vines, are fine. They range from cherries and cola to sweet cured tobacco and buttered cinnamon toast to smoky vanilla. If the wine had a crisper, livelier mouthfeel, it would score a lot higher.",89
Paul Gregutt,Tamarack Cellars 2005 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is spicy and varietally specific, with sharp, tight, bright red berry flavors and a peppery finish. Made in a forward, fruit-powered style, it should be enjoyed while the youthful exuberance is there in full bloom. In   the very back of the finish are hints of smoked meat.",89
,Murrieta's Well 2004 Meritage (Livermore Valley),"The blend is 51% Cabernet Sauvignon, 21% Merlot, 18% Petit Verdot and 10% Cabernet Franc. The result is a medium-bodied, softly textured red wine with flavors of black cherries, tobacco and vanilla that finishes velvety smooth. Drink now.",89
Paul Gregutt,Coeur d'Alene 2005 Switchback Red Red (Washington),"Coeur d'Alene Cellars does a fine job with Syrah. This has much the same satiny, sexy black fruit as the more expensive Opulence bottling, but it is more accessible and forward, with less power in the back end. Still, it's quite delicious, and the smoky tannins add some extra authority.",89
Roger Voss,Bouchard Aîné & Fils 2005 Les Marconnets Premier Cru  (Beaune),"Typical Beaune in its round, soft character. If the tannins are not particularly powerful, it still shows a generous nature, with super-ripe fruits supported by some dryness. The finish is jammy, ripe, a salad of red berries.",89
Paul Gregutt,Whitman Cellars 2005 Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"A dark and richly spicy wine, with penetrating varietal scents of pepper and berry. The wine is tart and youthful, and along with the tangy flavors of berry and spice there is a layer of graphite and a hint of cured meat reaching into the finish. It's sappy, racy and bright, but also layered and showing ageworthy potential. Tannins just hint at green tea.",89
Roger Voss,Zull 2006 Aussere Bergen Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),"This single-vineyard Grüner is powerful, with concentrated white fruit flavors, floral aromas and great, crisp, fresh acidity. The fruit is ripe, hinting at creamy, with a soft green aftertaste. Screwcap.",89
Paul Gregutt,Helix by Reininger 2005 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is a welcome return for this value Merlot after the 2004 vintage was skipped. The smooth and chocolaty flavors that consumers love are there, but they have been pulled back, letting more of the cherry fruit and subtle accents of forest floor, fungus and earth show through. It's textural, complex and thoroughly enjoyable.",89
Michael Schachner,Tomero 2007 Torrontés (Salta),"Tomero is a new line from the Carlos Pulenta group, and this one sings the tale of Salta with sincerity. You get telling acacia and lychee aromas, but none of the cheap perfume that can sometimes ruin the variety. The palate is lightly oily but linear, while the papaya, citrus and melon flavors just roll along.",89
Michael Schachner,Trivento 2005 Golden Reserve Malbec (Mendoza),"An intense, forward style of Malbec. The nose oozes a mixture of mint, black-fruit extract and shoe polish, while the saturated palate is racy and just rich enough; the flavors of blackberry and plum are lively with coffee and mocha accents on the finish. A bit acidic and racy, but that won't hurt it if served with food.",89
,Breggo 2006 Ferrington Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Anderson Valley),"Too bad the vineyard owner is pulling out the Sauvignon Blanc, because this is a fresh, vibrant, juicy one, crisp in acidity and rich in citrus, figs, pears and melons. Just a touch of tart gooseberry shows up in the finish.",89
Roger Voss,Bründlmayer 2004 Pinot Noir Cécile Pinot Noir (Kamptal),"No surprise that Willi Bründlmayer is one of the few in Austria to have real success with Pinot Noir. This is soft, ripe, enveloping, with bitter cherry flavors rounded at the edges with sweet tannins and refreshing acidity.",89
,Schug 2004 Heritage Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),"Here's a Cab that needs food to round it off and polish its rough edges. Very dry and a bit angular in tannins, with a peppery bite and generous flavors of cherries and blackberries.",89
Paul Gregutt,Tagaris 2006 Alice Vineyard Malbec (Wahluke Slope),"This is a dark, sappy, saturated wine, and the power and grip of the fruit belies its claim of 12.9% alcohol. The Malbec is plenty ripe without being over-ripe, and the fruit retains a certain muscularity, along with a mélange of cherries, plums, rum-soaked raisins and coffee liqueur. Thoroughly delicious and captivating.",89
Michael Schachner,Torres 2005 Celeste Crianza  (Ribera del Duero),"Torres' Celeste debuted in 2003, and the '05 is the best vintage to date. The wine has penetrating berry and spice aromas and an accent of animal leather. The palate is healthy and polished, with plum, blackberry and herbal notes. Comes together well and should be good in the cellar through 2012.",89
,Beaulieu Vineyard 2010 Coastal Estates Chardonnay (California),"A solid effort that delivers all the buttery, creamy and fruity flavors most consumers love. Clean and vibrant in mouthwatering acidity, it's rich in pineapple, orange and spicy pear flavors.",86
Joe Czerwinski,Stoneburn 2009 Pinot Noir (Marlborough),"At only $12 per bottle, this is a solid value. The aromas are slightly dusty, like dried rose petal, while the flavors suggest mixed berries and dry earth, with a hint of black tea on the finish. Tannins are silky. Drink now.",86
Michael Schachner,Trivento 2010 Reserve Malbec (Mendoza),"Fresh and reasonably fruity on the nose, but it's also slightly gritty and tough. Shows medium weight and intensity in the mouth, with a medicinal red-berry flavor accented by spice and herb notes. It finishes dry and mildly oaky.",86
Michael Schachner,Verum 2010 Malbec (Alto Valle del Río Negro),"A blackened wine, with piercing, dense aromas of shoe polish, charred oak, dark spice and black fruit. It feels solid and juicy, with black-tasting flavors that focus on espresso and dark spice. The finish is a bit short on fruit.",86
Michael Schachner,Viña Alicia 2008 Morena Red (Luján de Cuyo),"This blend of 88% Cabernet Sauvignon and 12% Cabernet Franc is rustic smelling, with a rubbery, tannic mouthfeel and flavors of roasted plum and berry. Let this wine aerate to show its best.",86
Roger Voss,Bott Frères 2010 Cuvée Particulière Muscat (Alsace),"Attractive spicy wine with a lively, lightly spicy character. It is rich without being heavy, showing acidity while also having a smooth texture on the finish.",86
,Ca' dei Zago 2010 Col Fondo  (Prosecco),"This has some light deposits at the bottom of the bottle, with a slightly cloudy appearance. Aromas of stone fruit, melon and citrus create a broad and thick aromatic front.",86
,Carpenè Malvolti NV Cuvée Brut  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore),"There's a touch of burnt almond at the start, but this bright effort soon picks up speed thanks to delicate aromas of honey, cantaloupe and white peach. This is smooth and creamy on the finish.",86
Roger Voss,Dopff & Irion 2010 Tradition Pinot Gris (Alsace),"Fresh, with an attractive line of acidity that complements the spice and rich texture. It's dry on the finish, remaining crisp and ripe. This is a real food wine.",86
,Galaxy 2008 Syrah-Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon Red (Sonoma-Napa),"This is fruity as a pastry, with flavors of nougat, blackberry and cherry jam, toasted almond and honey. Modern in style, the texture is soft, with melted tannins.",86
Michael Schachner,Gardel 2010 Vendimia Especial Malbec (Mendoza),"Black in color, this wine has reduced aromas of blueberry, cumin and bitter chocolate. Thick and generous in the mouth, but also rugged, with sweet blackberry and bacon flavors and a lot of toasty-oak influence.",86
,Giavi 2011 Prima Volta Millesimato Dry  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore),"Prima Volta (“first time”) is a fresh and easy wine, with medium intensity and bright aromas of honey, peach and white flower. The mouthfeel is lean and compact, but the persistent perlage keeps it lively.",86
,Anna Spinato NV Mini  (Prosecco),"Packaged in a pocket-friendly 187-ml bottle, this is fragrant and simple, with tonic, creamy foam and bright aromas of peach, honeydew and jasmine.",86
,Bellenda 2011 Miraval Millesimato Extra Dry  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore),"A genuine, honest sparkler, this has simple tones of almond paste and lemon soda. The mouthfeel is held steady by foamy cream and bright effervescence.",86
,Bianca Vigna 2011 Millesimato Brut  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore),"This sparkler opens with tonic, almost steely perlage that tickles the nose. The bouquet is comprised of crushed stone and white peach, and there's a distant hint of honey at the close.",86
,Canella NV  Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore,The simple bouquet is dominated by white rose and peach blossom aromas. This shows a nice quality of creamy effervescence as well.,86
,Caposaldo NV Brut  (Prosecco),"This is simple, showing dry tones of crushed stone and white peach. There is some softness in the mouth thanks to the creamy quality of the wine's foamy bubbles.",86
,Carpenè Malvolti NV Extra Dry  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore),"Direct and immediate, this crisp effort shows pretty balance between its sweet fruit and zesty citrus elements. A perfect summer-sipping sparkling wine.",86
Paul Gregutt,Coelho 2010 Atração Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"At first this shows some earthy, volatile aromas. The mineral-driven palate has tart, slightly bitter fruit flavors, suggesting crabapple and wild berry.",86
,Coho 2009 Headwaters Red (Napa Valley),"Toasty, caramelized oak dominates the aroma and flavor of this Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend. It tastes soft and a little short of power.",86
,Cupcake 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Coast),"A nice, sophisticated Cabernet to drink now Dry and crisp in acidity, it has a solid framework of tannins, giving structure to the blackberry and currant flavors.",86
Roger Voss,Domaine Ostertag 2010 Vignoble d'Epfig Riesling (Alsace),"Spice and cream dominate this attractive wine. With its full flavors of spice and pear, there is a also a hint of flower. An attractive wine that is developing quickly.",86
Roger Voss,Domaine Rieflé 2008 Steinert Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"Orange and mandarin flavors mark this warm, full-bodied wine. It's forward and fruity, showing a sweeter character, with vanilla and spice tones. Drink soon.",86
,Donati 2008 Ezio Red (Paicines),"Riper and fruitier than Donati's less expensive '08s, the Ezio is a Bordeaux-style blend based on Cabernet Sauvignon. This swaps elegance for a more full-bodied, robust style that comes across as heavy.",86
Michael Schachner,Andeluna 2010 Malbec (Mendoza),"Solid on the bouquet, this has notes of dark fruit and smoke, with an almond-like sweetness. Big, bulky and bullish in the mouth, it has roasted, meaty flavors that include campfire smoke, flamed meat and black fruit. The finish tastes charred but feels healthy and lively.",86
Roger Voss,Georges Duboeuf 2015 Château de Juliénas  (Juliénas),"This is one of several estates in this cru appellation where Georges Duboeuf makes and markets the wine. It is lightly wood aged to smooth out the ebullient fruits. Rich and with some firm tannins that will develop, it has concentration and a dense texture. Drink from 2018.",90
Roger Voss,Georges Duboeuf 2015 Château des Capitans  (Juliénas),"This cru estate is owned by the Duboeuf family. The wine has some wood aging that adds to the rich texture while not detracting from the ripe juicy red-cherry fruit. With its tannins, the wine could age, so drink from late 2017.",90
Roger Voss,Georges Duboeuf 2015 Domaine de Javernière Côte du Py  (Morgon),"From the south-east facing Côte du Py, this is a powerfully structured wine. It is as full of tannins as of ripe red fruits. The wine with its dense character it likely to age well over several years. Drink from 2018.",90
Roger Voss,Georges Duboeuf 2015 Domaine des Quatres Vents  (Fleurie),"Owned by the Darroze family, the cru wine from this estate is produced by Georges Duboeuf. It is a dense wine with balancing rich black fruits. Its spicy cherry-fruit flavor and rich tannins give a wine that should age further. Drink from 2018.",90
Virginie Boone,Hess Collection 2013 19 Block Mountain Cuvée Red (Mount Veeder),"This is an estate-grown blend of 61% Malbec, 33% Cabernet Sauvignon, 3% Petit Verdot and 3% Syrah.

Kerin O’Keefe,Il Borro 2013 Red (Toscana),"Made with 50% Merlot, 35% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Syrah and 5% Petit Verdot, this has subdued aromas suggesting underbrush, clove, dark-skinned berry and French oak. The smooth vibrant palate delivers red currant, unripe cherry, mocha and dried sage alongside fine-grained tannins. An orange zest note closes the finish.",90
Virginie Boone,Iron Horse 2011 Russian Cuvée Sparkling (Green Valley),"First made during the Reagan-Gorbachev years, this blend of 74% Pinot Noir and 26% Chardonnay tastes of hazelnut torte and almond paste, offering richness interwoven with moderate acidity. On the lusherside of the sparkling spectrum, it offers a sweetness of peach, brown sugar and lemon meringue.",90
Anne Krebiehl MW,Lackner Tinnacher 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Südsteiermark),"Mossy freshness and fragrance appear on the shy subdued nose. The wonderfully slender and sprightly palate is fresh and delicate. There is something subtle and lithe about this, which is very uplifting. The finish is refreshing and clean.",90
Sean P. Sullivan,Lauren Ashton Cellars 2013 Proprietor's Cuvée Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Cabernet Sauvignon makes up over 70% of this blend with the balance Merlot, Petit Verdot and Malbec. It shows aromas of dark cherries, licorice and brooding black fruit that at times seems slightly dried out. The palate shows elegantly styled dark-fruit flavors that linger on the finish.",90
Matt Kettmann,Now Presenting... 2014 Red (Paso Robles),"This is quite a dynamic and layered wine, especially for the bargain price, with deep and hearty blackberry, caramel, rust, lavender and potpourri on the nose. The berry-led palate is rustic and unrefined, with feral flavors, peppery spice and decent acidity.",90
Jim Gordon,On Point 2014 Christina's Cuvée Pinot Noir (North Coast),"Full bodied and definitely fruity without being sweet, this wine from Fulcrum comes straight at the taste buds with opulent black cherry and tart raspberry flavors on a vivid texture. Having spent 15 months in French oak before bottling, it tastes a bit dense and muted at this point, and should be best after 2018.",90
Roger Voss,Pardon et Fils 2015 Les Mouilles  (Juliénas),Ripe perfumed black fruits dominate this cru wine. They float above the firm tannins and concentrated acidity to offer a wine that will become rich and generous as it develops. A touch of pepper and spice adds to the layers of fruit. Drink from 2018,90
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Paumanok 2014 Cabernet Franc (North Fork of Long Island),"Spice and green pepper notes accentuate ripe luscious blackberry and cassis flavors in this classically inspired Cabernet Franc. Fine tannins and fresh cutting acidity lend vibe to the midpalate. Fleshy and ripe yet pleasantly herbaceous, it's ready to drink now but should hold well through 2022.",90
Joe Czerwinski,Jean-Luc Colombo 2013 Amour de Dieu  (Condrieu),"This wine seems broad across the palate, but not quite as deep as some Condrieus. The fruit is understated, resembling gently toasted marshmallow and maybe a touch of baked pineapple, rather than flamboyant apricot and spice. Plan on serving it with fish or chicken rather than something rich or extravagant.",90
Virginie Boone,Acacia 2013 Thornton Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This wine is big in tannin, extracted and full bodied, with dense blueberry and maple syrup at its core. For fans of a rich style, it will impress for  its ripe, dark fruit and sizable yet velvety mouthfeel.",90
Joe Czerwinski,Alain Jaume et Fils 2014 Haut de Brun Red (Côtes du Rhône),"This blend of 60% Grenache, 30% Syrah and 10% Cinsault would be a crowd favorite if more than 700 cases were available in the U.S. The black cherry fruit is punched up by hints of herbs and cracked pepper, there's ample weight but great freshness and zest, and the finish is long and complex, showing off hints of licorice, pepper and dusty earth. Drink now–2020.",90
Kerin O’Keefe,San Carlo 2011  Brunello di Montalcino,"Ripe and round, this offers enticing scents of violet, rose, perfumed berry and a whiff of pressed powder. The big juicy palate doles out fleshy black cherry, raspberry star anise and chopped herb alongside chewy tannins.",90
Virginie Boone,Sean Minor 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This smooth, lean red attractively delivers above its price point. Tart in clove and currant, it finishes with a whiplash of mocha.",90
Anne Krebiehl MW,Steininger 2015 Grand Grü Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),"A slightly earthy nose of yellow plum and stone fruit leads to a fresh textured palate, which shows off mirabelles and lemons. There is a pleasant phenolic edge and a clean, long finish.",90
Anne Krebiehl MW,Stift Klosterneuburg 2014 Ausstich St. Laurent (Thermenregion),"The dark red fruit is enveloped in the rounded, rich and chocolaty scent of oak. The palate shows a lighter side with delicate fruit of a red-cherry nature. Freshness sumptuous oak and red-cherry notes marry well. This is lovely now, but just a few more months in bottle will allow it to knit together more. Drink now through 2020.",90
Roger Voss,Terroirs et Talents 2015 Clos de la Brosse  (Saint-Amour),A four-acre parcel of old vines is the source of this dense and rich wine. It has jammy red berry and cherry fruits that are lifted by the mineral texture and acidity. The wine is balanced although it does need to age. Drink from the end of 2017.,90
Kerin O’Keefe,Tua Rita 2013 Redigaffi Merlot (Toscana),"Cassis, bell pepper, toast, French oak and coconut lead the nose. The aromas carry over to the tightly wound palate along with raw red currant, powdered sage, licorice and a confectionery note. Close-grained tannins leave a rather astringent finish.",90
Anne Krebiehl MW,Unger 2015 Oberfeld Alte Reben Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal),A subdued nose leads onto a fresh easy-drinking palate that is characterized by generous spritz and ripe almost plump pear fruit that is just tempered by citrus freshness. This is so easy to drink and so refreshing with that spritz.,90
Sean P. Sullivan,Vino La Monarcha 2014 Sangiovese (Wahluke Slope),Very varietal aromas of sour cherry and cranberry lead to a fruit-filled flavorful palate. Light oak accents linger on the finish. It's a very pleasing example of the variety.,90
Sean P. Sullivan,Vino La Monarcha 2015 Riesling (Ancient Lakes),"This is an aromatic wine, with scents of green melon candy, lime zest, white flowers and white peach. It drinks off dry, with stone-fruit flavors brightened by zippy acidity leading to a mouthwatering finish.",90
Jim Gordon,Whiplash 2015 Red (California),"Concentrated flavors and a richly tannic texture make this dry wine more sophisticated and interesting than many other red blends. It combines cranberry, black cherry and cinnamon notes for a mouthfilling and harmonious impression.",90
Virginie Boone,Bell 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"With a perfumed nose of rose and toasted oak, this wine is thick in red fruit, dense oak and a welcome undercurrent of bright acidity that helps keep it fresh in the glass. Small amounts of Merlot, Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec are all within.",90
Kerin O’Keefe,Cerbaia 2011  Brunello di Montalcino,"Inviting aromas of dark-skinned fruit, blue flower, leather and a whiff of baking spice waft out of the glass. The firm juicy palate offers ripe wild cherry, licorice and hint of charcuterie while assertive, seasoned tannins provide support. Drink through 2021.",90
Virginie Boone,Gibbs 2014 Bacigalupi Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Golden caramelized oak supports a fleshy, full-bodied sensation of pear and fig in this bold, rich wine. Resolved on the palate and possessed of moderate acidity, it finishes in a plume of nutmeg.",90
Virginie Boone,Gloria Ferrer NV Sonoma Brut Sparkling (Sonoma County),"Creamy, lush and somewhat robust, this dry sparkler offers a thick mousse and touch of richness in its mix of nutty bread dough, green apple, pear and lime.",90
Michael Schachner,Bodegas Valdemar 2005 Inspiración  (Rioja),"This unusual varietal wine hits with a giant wall of herbal aromas that suggest tomato leaf, oregano and basil. The palate is firm and structured in feel, with smacking tannins and flavors of dark berry fruits, green herbs and coffee. A peppery tasting finish with residual green flavors and mocha works for this decidedly herbal-leaning but high-quality wine. Drink now.",88
Michael Schachner,Bula 2010 Red (Montsant),"Scratchy plum and raspberry aromas are fresh and forward, while the mouthfeel follows suit; it's juicy, with narrowing acidity and brightness. Flavors of raspberry, plum and cherry end zesty and long, with crisp acidity maintaining focus. This is a blend of Carignan (Mazuelo), Garnacha and Syrah.",88
Paul Gregutt,Bunchgrass 2009 Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Though not indicated on the label, once again the Morrison Lane vineyard—the oldest Syrah planting in Walla Walla—is the source of the fruit. The wine is peppery and tannic, with cherry fruit and dried herbal accents. There's a whiff of toast in the finish.",88
Michael Schachner,Can Blau 2010 Blau Red (Montsant),"This straightforward, perfectly clean blend of Carignan, Syrah and Garnacha would function as a great everyday house red. It's lively and a little racy and grating on the palate, with standard, fresh berry flavors touched up by a sprinkle of chocolaty oak. A modest finish keeps the vibe positive.",88
,Cantina Produttori San Michele Appiano 2011 Sanct Valentin Gewürztraminer (Alto Adige),Sweet peach nectar and fragrant white flower open the nose of this lush Gewürztraminer. The wine feels slightly sweet and sticky on the palate with rich density and a waxy finish.,88
Virginie Boone,"Carol Shelton 2009 Monga Zin, Lopez Vineyard Zinfandel (Cucamonga Valley)","Sourced from dry farmed, organic vines planted in 1918, Carol Shelton's Monga is a mouthful of a wine, layered with cinnamon spice, blueberry, chocolate and oak, and still very concentrated and dry, with room to grow and mellow.",88
Michael Schachner,Casa Rojo 2009 Fauno Organic Grapes Garnacha (Priorat),"This is a big, modern, warm Garnacha with a lot of oak and vanilla on the bouquet as well as blackberry and cassis. It's jammy on the tongue, but there's enough acidity to keep the pulse up. Dark black cherry, berry and rubbery flavors are followed by end-notes of raisin, chocolate and vanilla.",88
,Castello di Montegiove 2008 Elicius Red (Umbria),"This red blend from Umbria offers a decadent bouquet that consists of rich chocolate and bright cherry intensity. The wine is smooth and chewy with a plush, velvety texture.",88
Roger Voss,Château de la Croix 2009  Médoc,"A solid, ripe, juicy black fruited wine, delicious already with its fragrant fruits. It has structure that supports the attractive surface, giving shape to this lightly textured wine. Keep for 4–5 years, but also drink now.",88
Roger Voss,Château d'Esclans 2012 Whispering Angel Rosé (Côtes de Provence),"A delightfully clean and fruity wine, the epitome of Provence rosé. It has fresh acidity, crisp lemon and red currant fruit and just a light sprinkling of spice.",88
Roger Voss,Château Dupeyrat Plouget 2010 Cru de Plouget  (Côtes de Bourg),"Stalky wine, its black currant fruits tight and still developing. It has a juicy character that comes from the intense youthful acidity and that will blend over the next 4–5 years.",88
,Chelsea Goldschmidt 2011 Merlot (Dry Creek Valley),"Polished and pretty, this Merlot delivers plenty of juicy cherry, red currant, mocha and toast flavors that are lovely to drink now. The wine is smooth and softly tannic—just what you want Merlot to be.",88
,Peju 2009 Merlot (Napa Valley),"This wine is a little direct, but very tasty, showing rich, ripe cherry, red currant, cocoa and sweet oak flavors, wrapped into lovely tannins. A polished, pretty wine for drinking now.",88
,Pope Valley Winery 2010 Eakle Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This dry, tannic wine is astringent now, in the way of a young Cabernet. It has a heart of ripe blackberries and currants, and finishes dry and clean. There's a rustic edge that  suggests drinking over the next 2–3 years.",88
Michael Schachner,Real Sitio de Ventosilla 2004 RSV 1601 El Duque de Lerma  (Ribera del Duero),"With damp earth and crusty leather aromas, this is a heavy wine with baked fruit, a syrupy mouthfeel and flavors of mocha, carob, leafy berry and earth. On the finish, it's full bodied and soft, with ripe black-fruit flavors that register as thick and a touch raisiny. Drink now.",88
,Stryker Sonoma 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"Masses of sweet blackberry jam give this Cabernet an easy deliciousness. The fruit and oak are balanced with fine tannins and a gentle scour of acidity. Not one for the cellar, but it will benefit from an hour or two in the decanter.",88
,Talamonti 2012 Trabocchetto Pecorino (Colline Pescaresi),Pecorino is a fascinating white grape from Central Italy that deserves a special look. This expression bursts open with tones of acacia flower and stone fruit and delivers medium density and richness on the finish.,88
Paul Gregutt,The Eyrie Vineyards 2011 Estate Chardonnay (Dundee Hills),"This fine-honed Chardonnay hews to the Eyrie house style. It may seem austere at first, but the green and yellow fruit flavors are ripe, not vegetal, and the firm acidity makes it a fine food match. Give it plenty of time to breathe before serving.",88
,The Farm Winery 2009 Touchy-Feely G-S-M (Paso Robles),"This Rhône-style blend is fruity and delicious. It has raspberry, cherry, licorice, mocha and spice flavors, wrapped into easy tannins, brightened with a bite of lime acidity. Ready to enjoy now.",88
,Tre Monti 2009 Thea Riserva  (Sangiovese di Romagna Superiore),"Thea Riserva opens with dark and austere notes of black licorice, tar, black cherry and crushed granite. There's a dusty quality to the close followed by a dry but fresh finish.",88
,Trueheart 2010 Truehart Vineyard Petite Sirah (Sonoma Valley),"Shows the dark color, thick tannins and deep, concentrated flavors you expect from Petite Sirah. It's a big gulp of blackberry jam, espresso, dark chocolate and crushed black pepper, and the finish is thoroughly dry. Lacks the acidic vibrancy needed for aging, but a fine wine to drink now.",88
Michael Schachner,Val do Sosego 2011 Albariño (Rías Baixas),"Ripe apple aromas make the nose nice, even though it's flattening with age. Likewise on the palate, which delivers pithy orange and dry melon flavors along with indications that it's just starting to fade. Notes of green herbs and scallion come up on the finish. Drink this mature white immediately.",88
Paul Gregutt,J. Christopher 2010 Nuages Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"A blend of grapes from several vineyards, this is named for a famous jazz tune. The blending both softens and expands the mid-palate, and seems to have boosted the aging curve. It's ready to drink, with strawberry fruit, a dusting of cocoa, a hint of wet cement, and a finish with cola and sassafras.",88
,J. Lohr 2010 Gesture G-S-M (Paso Robles),"Frankly delicious, offering wave after wave of black cherry jam, red currant, licorice, mocha, vanilla and buttered cinnamon toast flavors, wrapped into soft, smooth tannins.",88
Roger Voss,Johanneshof Reinisch 2012 Rotgipfler (Thermenregion),"Rotgipfler is almost an exclusivity to Thermenregion. This bright, fruity wine is deliciously crisp with spice, pepper and pear flavors. It has a light lemon edge brought out by the refreshing acidity. Screwcap.",88
,Lynmar 2011 Monastery Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"This is one of Lynmar's most expensive Chardonnays, of their six 2011s. It's also one of the most forward and oakiest. Your first impression is of sweet buttered toast, sprinkled with brown sugar and drizzled with melted butterscotch. Then the tropical fruits kick in, brightened with citrusy acids. It's an impressive feat, but the wine feels overworked, and lacks the sustaining interest of Lynmar's other bottlings.",88
Michael Schachner,Matetic 2011 EQ Chardonnay (San Antonio),"The nose sends up signals of a balanced, easygoing wine with oak blended nicely into pear and apple fruit. The palate is lively and mildly oaky, with baked apple, orange and woodspice flavors. A snappy, oaky finish with intense acidity closes the show.",88
Michael Schachner,Oliver Conti 2011 Treyu White (Empordà),"The nose on this blend of Gewurztraminer and Macabeo defines neutral; it's clean but shows little more than a whiff of apple. The palate is fresh and quick moving, with mild peach, pear, apple and melon flavors that culminate in a solid finish that's not very exciting but doesn't stray.",88
,Parcel 41 2011 Merlot (Napa Valley),"This is a good value for a sophisticated Merlot from Napa Valley. It's not an ager, but it's delightful now for its dryness, smooth tannins and complex cherry and red currant flavors with hints of herbs and sweet peas.",88
,Drei Donà Tenuta La Palazza 2009 Pruno Riserva  (Sangiovese di Romagna Superiore),There's a dark and masculine quality to this Sangiovese from Romagna that makes this wine perfect for pork or breaded veal. Dark cherry and prune are backed by bright acidity.,88
Jim Gordon,401K 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"A gentle wine, this has warm, fruity aromas, ripe red cherry and raspberry flavors, a soft texture and fine-grained tannins. Medium to full bodied and almost sweet in balance, it's easy to enjoy.",86
Sean P. Sullivan,Barnard Griffin 2014 Fumé Blanc Dry Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A mix of Sauvignon Blanc (77%) and Sémillon, this wine comes from three separate vineyards in the Columbia Valley. It shows plenty of Sauvignon's herbal character while also displaying the ripeness of the vintage, with lightly spritzy tropical fruit and fig flavors that possess a fleshy feel.",86
Sean P. Sullivan,Cana's Feast 2013 Northridge Vineyard Primitivo (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wine doesn't seem to have fully ripened, with green, reedy aromas along with notes of cranberry and cherry Jolly Rancher. The full-bodied palate delivers more but seems disconnected with tart, tangy cranberry flavors.",86
Kerin O’Keefe,Cantine Leonardo Da Vinci 2010 Da Vinci Riserva  (Chianti),"Aromas of toast, oak, espresso and a whiff of smoke lead the nose. The palate offers oak extract, coconut, coffee and vanilla but there's not enough fruit richness to support the oak. It's already reached its ideal drinking window so enjoy sooner rather than later.",86
Virginie Boone,Hill Family Estate 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A stamp of smoke and toasted oak mark the entry into this wine, followed by chewy tannins that wrap themselves around dark layers of chocolate and tobacco leaf, the structure at first impenetrable. The finish is relaxed and somewhat short.",86
Sean P. Sullivan,James Wyatt 2013 Untamed Cuvée Red (Yakima Valley),"This lightly colored wine blends Grenache (43%), Syrah (32%) and Mourvèdre. It brings aromas of red raspberries, currant and flowers. The palate is fresh and lighter in style, with the emphasis on fruit.",86
Roger Voss,Liebart-Régnier NV Brut  (Champagne),"There are flavors of peanuts as well as the more usual white fruits in this wine that is rounded and soft, with gentle acidity. The wine, fresh at the end, is ready to drink.",86
Matt Kettmann,Vinum 2013 White Elephant White (California),"This tradition-bucking blend of 61% Chenin Blanc, 31% Viognier and 8% Roussanne offers soft aromas of sweet apple blossoms and peach, with a hint of barrel smoke. The palate offers a similar blend of peaches, pears and apples, warmed up with some oak influence.",86
Kerin O’Keefe,Viticoltori Senesi Aretini 2009 Riserva  (Chianti),"Aromas of toast, milk chocolate and black-skinned fruit lead the way. The soft, low-acid palate doles out crushed plum, fleshy cherry and mocha alongside drying, angular tannins that create an abrupt finish.",86
Jim Gordon,Wise Villa 2013 Estate Grown Sangiovese (Placer County),"A strong oak influence dampens the varietal character in this full-bodied, spicy wine. It smells like cinnamon and cedar, tastes slightly sweet and smoky, is full bodied and rich in texture. Nice and smooth, it shows only mild varietal character.",86
Virginie Boone,MacPhail 2014 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This is a substantial wine, concentrated in dark red berry color and flavor, from cherry to wild strawberry to more savory rhubarb compote. Muted on the nose, it has an underlying woody, herbal character that balances the vibrancy of the fruit.",86
Roger Voss,Maison Bouey 2012 Château Lestruelle  (Médoc),"If only this wine wasn't extracted so much (which gives bitterness), it would be ripe and fruity. As it is, it's hard to get past the tight, dry tannins. There are hints of juiciness and black currant fruits. It might soften by 2016.",86
Roger Voss,Maison Bouey 2014 Le Rosé Gourmand de Lestruelle Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé),"This crisp, fruity wine has delicious acidity. Gray-pink in color, it is ripe with red berries that also impart attractive freshness. The wine is crisp, tangy and textured at the end.",86
Kerin O’Keefe,Mannucci Droandi 2009 Ceppeto Riserva  (Chianti Classico),"This blend of Sangiovese and 10% Merlot opens with aromas of forest floor, ripe blackberry, cedar and menthol. The warm, evolved palate offers dried black cherry, licorice, mint, ground pepper and a gamy note alongside assertive, almost gritty tannins that leave an astringent finish.",86
Virginie Boone,Rosenblum 2012 Winemaker Selection Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"Flavors of berry, vanilla and tar form around thick, rich tannins, giving this wine a puckering quality that may benefit from opening before enjoying. The finish is sturdy and robust in leathery black pepper.",86
Kerin O’Keefe,Travignoli 2013  Chianti Rufina,"Here's a bright, informal red that offers sour cherry, red berry and a light note of cooking spice. Lively acidity and soft, rather fleeting tannins give it an easy-drinking quality.",86
Virginie Boone,Hanaiali'i 2013 Merlot (Napa Valley),"This 100% Merlot offers a lot of heat around its otherwise approachable lift of soft, smooth tannins and reasonable oak. Sage, cedar and tobacco provide a weedy aspect to the wine, offset by plenty of ripe blackberry and cherry.",86
Sean P. Sullivan,Lagana 2013 Breezy Slope Vineyard Pinot Noir (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Grown in the southern section of the valley in the foothills of the Blue Mountains, this rare varietal bottling from this appellation shows aromas of cranberry, raspberry and citrus, along with some hints of oxidation. It's tart and full in feel, not seeming entirely varietally correct.",86
Sean P. Sullivan,Lagana 2013 Minnick Hills Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This is an aromatically brooding wine with notes of herbs, pepper and brown spices. It drinks quite sweet with a lightly chalky feel.",86
Matt Kettmann,Loft 2013 Merlot (Monterey),"This is box wine taken seriously, even featuring a picture of winemaker Denise Wordenon. Fresh-squeezed blueberry fruit mixes with black rocks, milk chocolate and cedar on the nose, followed by an easy-to-quaff juiciness on the lightly bodied palate. It's not very complex, but perfect for summer barbecues or car camping.",86
Michael Schachner,Matsu 2013 El Picaro  (Toro),"Rough, animal-like aromas wrestle with piercing, fairly hot plum and berry scents. Rubbery, blackened, peppery plum and raspberry flavors finish oaky, mildly bitter and tannic.",86
Anne Krebiehl MW,Nadler 2014 Grüner Veltliner (Carnuntum),"The nose here is not quite as clean-cut as it could be, while the palate shows a little more focus. Crisp and zesty, if a little short.",86
Sean P. Sullivan,:Nota Bene 2011 Ciel du Cheval Red (Red Mountain),"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this offers aromas of raisinated cherries, herbs, bittersweet chocolate and a whiff of barnyard. Medicinal flavors are backed by chalky tannins.",86
Joe Czerwinski,Oyster Bay 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"At this scale (170,000 cases imported), the quality is remarkable. Leafy notes accent pink grapefruit aromas and flavors, coming together in a harmonious, easy-drinking finish.",86
Roger Voss,Piot-Sévillano NV Tradition Brut  (Champagne),"Rounded, soft and smoothly creamy, this is a ripe wine dominated by Pinot Meunier. It's an open wine, fruity and ready to drink.",86
Roger Voss,Quai de la Lune 2014 Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé),"Well-crafted and fruity, this has a fresh character that allows room for red berry flavors. It's a ripe wine, keeping freshness while bringing in a warmer, caramel character.",86
Michael Schachner,Bodegas Berceo 2013 Viñadrian  (Rioja),"Earthy notes of saline and cheesy leather accent plum aromas on this tight number with rubbery tannins. Plum, cherry and herbal flavors carry some bitterness onto a finish with medicinal plum notes.",86
Kerin O’Keefe,Cennatoio 2011 O'Leandro Riserva  (Chianti Classico),"Made with Sangiovese and a small percentage of Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with aromas of coconut, toast and oak-driven spice. The evolved palate offers coconut, clove and ground black pepper but the fruit richness has almost dried up entirely, leaving an astringent finish.",86
Roger Voss,Château Buisson-Redon 2014  Bordeaux Blanc,"Intense with acidity and young fruitiness, this wine needs some time. The potential of the white and citrus fruit is there, with an herbaceous character that needs to soften. Drink from late 2015.",86
Virginie Boone,St. Supéry 2014 Estate Grown Moscato (Napa Valley),"This wine made from Muscat Canelli grapes is slightly spritzy and sweet, pungent in apricot fuzz and grass, a mélange of tropical goodness from there on out. Mango, kiwi and pineapple fill the medium-weight waves of viscous texture, concluding in a vanilla-tinged, light, fresh finish.",86
Roger Voss,Clos de Gamot 2002 Cuvée des Vignes Centenaires Malbec (Cahors),"This is a traditional style—emphasizing earthy tannins and spicy fruit and is rough around the edges—but is a wine that would relish being partnered with sausages, salamis and hard cheeses. There is plenty of weight, the acidity coming from minerality and wood.",87
Roger Voss,Companhia das Quintas 2007 Prova Régia Arinto (Bucelas),"Not many wines come from Bucelas today, as its vineyards get eaten up by the northern Lisbon suburbs. This Arinto-based wine suggests there should be some more of this ultra-crisp white, which bears a passing resemblance to a Vinho Verde in its super-fresh apple and grapefruit flavors.",87
,Cusumano 2007 Cubìa Insolia (Sicilia),"Pretty mineral notes recall chalk and dusty ash and provide depth and dimension to this fresh and fragrant white wine. There's not much fruit, but the wine pulls its own thanks to those mineral nuances and its crisp acidity.",87
Roger Voss,DFJ Vinhos 2007 Casa do Lago Rosé Touriga Nacional (Estremadura),"An attractive salmon pink-colored wine, very fresh, with bright red currant acidity, fleshed out with some caramel, raspberry and a dash of red apple skins texture.",87
,Tasca d'Almerita 2006 Lamùri Nero d'Avola (Sicilia),"Molasses, smoked bacon, beef jerky and loads of clove and exotic spice come to mind. Lamùri is a pure expression of Nero d'Avola that also offers plum, prune and blackberry. Despite the mature fruit flavors, the wine has good acidity and crispness.",87
,Tenuta delle Terre Nere 2007  Etna,"This is a mineral-driven wine from the blackened slopes of Mount Etna with delicate shadings of pear, peach, jasmine and honeysuckle. The overall impression is one of elegance—thanks to the jasmine notes in particular. It's a very special wine. A Marc de Grazia selection, various American importers.",87
,Tolosa 2007 Edna Ranch Rosé (Edna Valley),"With the wonderfully crisp acidity and bright, laser-pure fruit Edna Valley is known for, this Syrah, Grenache and Viognier blush offers a wealth of tasty raspberry, cherry, citrus fruit and spice flavors. Dry and clean, it shows California rosé near its best.",87
Joe Czerwinski,Turkey Flat 2005 The Turk Shiraz-Grenache-Cabernet-Mourvèdre Red (Barossa Valley),"This blend is mainly Shiraz (50%) and Grenache (28%), which accounts for the wine's ample, plummy fruit flavors. Accents of grilled meat and slightly briary overtones add complexity, and the wine finishes dry and savory. Drink now-2012.",87
Roger Voss,J. Portugal Ramos 2007 Marquês de Borba Red (Alentejo),"Portugal's popular brand is a lively, fresh, spice- and dried fruit-flavored wine. There are flavors of pound cake and nutmeg surrounding a core of solid, firm tannins. Great with food, this is not for aging.",87
,J Vineyards & Winery 2006 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Sturdy and hard in tannins, brisk in acids, this Pinot will benefit from a year or so in bottle. It's extremely dry, with earthy, balsam and mushroom-inspired flavors of blackberries, black cherries and cola.",87
,J. Wilkes 2006 Bien Nacido Vineyard Hillside Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),"Light in color and texture, with a silky, airy mouthfeel, this Pinot has elegant flavors of cherries, anise, vanilla, Asian spices and smoky wood. It's a polished wine for drinking now.",87
Michael Schachner,La Posta 2006 Cocina Blend Red (Mendoza),"“Cocina” means “the kitchen” in Spanish, and this blend of Malbec, Bonarda and Syrah is definitely a kitchen-sink type of wine. It's stout, a bit reduced and tinny at first, but with air it turns into a nice, simple chunkster with plump baked-fruit flavors and a soft but structured chocolaty finish. Drink now.",87
,Leone de Castris 2005 Maiana Rosso Red (Salice Salentino),"Here's an easy-going Salice Salentino (90% Negroamaro and 10% Malvasia Nera) with spice, cherry and cola notes that are weaved nicely together. There's harmony and elegance here and the wine leaves a spicy imprint on the close.",87
,Mastroberardino 2007  Greco di Tufo,This neutral and mineral-driven Greco offers tones of white stone and dried flowers. The wine is lean and crisp with a thin but refreshing consistency. It would make an excellent companion to spicy Indian or Thai foods.,87
Michael Schachner,Melipal 2006 Reserve Malbec (Mendoza),"Rubbery and smoky at first, with leather and berry fruit running secondary to the wine's more reduced qualities. But if given ten minutes to unwind, it shows wide black-fruit flavors, creaminess and finally some barrel-based resin. Gets better the more you work with it, but will always register as “oaky.”",87
Paul Gregutt,Morrison Lane 2005 Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This 2005 Syrah from Morrison Lane seems a bit lackluster compared with previous efforts. This is smoky and tight, a tannic wine with flavors of lead pencil, green tea and earth. But the fruit is quite light, tart, and does not seem to sync up with the heaviness of the tannins.",87
Paul Gregutt,Morrison Lane 2006 Viognier (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Picked late and fermented on native yeast, this Viognier brings some snap and spice to its scents and flavors. The lime and quinine quality recalls a good gin and tonic; it definitely leans to the herbal rather than the tropical side of Viognier, but is crisp and refreshing.",87
,Fazio 2005 Torre dei Venti Nero d'Avola (Sicilia),"Fazio makes the best of hot climate growing conditions and presents a well-composed Nero d'Avola that is enhanced by aromas of red apple, cassis, pomegranate and black cherry. There's good intensity here and some sweetness, although the mouthfeel is in no way heavy or thick.",87
Joe Czerwinski,Gemtree 2006 Uncut Shiraz (McLaren Vale),"Smoky, cedary notes nicely complement the blueberry fruit in this McLaren Vale Shiraz. It's pretty full on the palate, with a slightly syrupy texture that extends the flavors through a mouthwatering finish. Drink now-2012.",87
Paul Gregutt,Adamant Cellars 2006 Spofford Station Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This is 100% Syrah from an excellent vineyard. It's chewy and even a bit salty in the mouth, with a mix of bell pepper and black pepper over streaks of berry and cassis. Most of the flavor is front-loaded, and the wine fades away into an earthy, fairly tannic finish.",87
,Alberto Longo 2007 Le Fossette Falanghina (Puglia),"The bouquet here is very floral and intense: you'll get jasmine, honeysuckle, sweet apple, mango and other exotic fruits. The wine tastes clean, sweet and dense and has fragrant flavors that accompany you glass after glass.",87
,X 2006 ES Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Lake County),"Another super Sauvignon Blanc that shows how well Lake County does with this variety. It's all about the citrus, fig and spicy melon flavors and the juicy acidity, which makes the wine so fresh and clean. Made from the Musqué clone.",87
,Godwin 2005 Floral Clone Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Enormous in jammy apricot, peach, pineapple, Asian spice and sweet charred oak vanillins, this Burgundy-inspired Chard is a little sweet. But it provides enough acidity for balanced structure.",87
,Hagafen 2006 Ripken Vineyard Roussanne (Lodi),"A fresh, intriguing wine whose balance and depth suggest midterm aging. Golden in color, it's succulent in the flavors of peaches, pineapples, limes, almond biscotti and butterscotch, with fine acidity and a rich, honeyed finish. Give it until sometime in 2008 and for another couple of years.",87
Roger Voss,Herdade da Malhadinha Nova 2006 Monte da Peceguina Red (Alentejano),"The second wine from Malhadinha Nova is lively and fruity, packed with red fruits, sweet strawberry flavors and easy, ripe texture. Drink now.",87
,Bucklin 2005 Old Hill Ranch Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"With the '05, Bucklin is getting a handle on this old-vine field blend of two dozen varieties, which seems to do best in cooler years. It's a rustic-chic wine, with a brawny muscularity tamed by extreme dryness, and even though the alcohol is 15.6%, it doesn't feel too hot.",87
,Corley 2004 Proprietary Red Wine Red (Oak Knoll District),"Soft and fruity, this Bordeaux blend has a splash of Syrah. It's dry and grippy in tannins, and there's a dried herb edge to the blackberry fruit. Finishes polished and elegant, but the softness suggests early drinking.",87
Roger Voss,DFJ Vinhos 2004 Tinta Roriz and Merlot Red (Estremadura),"An unexpected combination perhaps, but it works to give a fresh, flavorful wine, with soft tannins, juicy fruit and flavors of red cherries and vanilla. Not complex, and ready to drink now.",87
Roger Voss,DFJ Vinhos 2006 Monte Alentejano White (Alentejano),"Fresh green-apple aromas and some ripe, mango flavors, this is well rounded, showing some acidity, but more of open, fresh fruits. This is a wine that will be perfect to drink over the next few months.",87
Michael Schachner,El Nido 2003 Clio Monastrell-Cabernet Sauvignon Red (Jumilla),"If all you're after is size, then sign on the dotted line. This blend is a monster that weighs in at 15.5%, so be ready for intensely sweet flavors of grape essence and licorice. To this judge, the wine has a lot of gumption but isn't what I'd want to drink glass after glass, day after day. It's lumbering, heavy but oh so sweet and dessert-like.",87
Susan Kostrzewa,Backsberg 2005 Pinotage (Coastal Region),"The wines of Backsberg have a distinctive, artistic quality to them that makes them ideal for collectors and drinkers who seek wines with style. This Pinotage has those qualities, with its layers of cinnamon and deep berry on the nose and smooth, integrated berry and smoke flavors. This is a real Pinotage so expect the rubbery smoke that goes along with it—but it's also elegant, offering structure and complexity with a gentle touch.",87
,Bonny Doon 2005 Le Cigar Blanc White (California),"The grapes were grown on the Central Coast, mostly in Arroyo Grande, and the wine is characterized by vibrant acidity. There is an intense taste of raspberries, more usually found in a red variety like Grenache than a white wine, but Grenache Blanc consitutes nearly half the blend, along with Roussanne.",87
Michael Schachner,Codorníu NV Brut Rosé Pinot Noir (Cava),"This one takes on an orange tint, and the aromas are akin to chocolate, spice cake and even some baked beans. The palate is quite crisp and healthy, with berry fruit, citrus and length. A good wine with a racy, cleansing feel. It's not spectacular but it ranks highly among similar competitors.",87
,Conte Collalto NV Extra Dry  (Prosecco di Conegliano e Valdobbiadene),"Thanks to its buoyant aromas of field flower, green apple, pear and dried sage leaf, you could definitely describe this as a multidimensional wine with noticeable elegance. There are musky, sweet fruit flavors on the finish.",87
,Schug 2006 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Schug's regular Pinot, as opposed to their Heritage Reserve, is a dependably village-style expression of easy-drinking, cool-climate Pinot Noir. The '06, like previous vintages, shows a silky, delicate texture framing cherry, raspberry and cola flavors, with a smoky vanilla edge of oak.",87
,St. Clement 2004 Star Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"A first bottle was obviously off. A second was better, although still lacking the complexity you want at this price. It was a young Cab, dry and tannic, with a core of cassis and cherries. A few years in the cellar should soften it.",87
,Arbios 2003 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"On a par with recent vintages, this four-year old Cab is soft and pleasant, with ripe cherry, blackberry, raspberry and herb flavors that are well oaked. The tannins are crunchy, but the wine isn't an ager. Best now through 2009.",87
,Adami NV Vigneto Giardino Dry  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene),"This is a dry Prosecco, meaning it is slightly sweeter than a brut or extra dry. Traditionally, Prosecco has this level of sugar, making it a very true rendition of what the wine is intended to taste like: Fresh peach, basil, pineapple, yellow apple and even an understated touch of banana come into play.",87
Roger Voss,Alentex 2006 Antão Vaz-Arinto White (Alentejo),"One of the principle grapes of the Alentejo, Antão Vaz blends easily with the Arinto of neighboring Ribatejo. There is an attractive citrus element to this wood-aged wine, soft, open, but remaining fresh, the tropical fruit flavors well under control.",87
,Bortolomiol 2005 Brut Millesimato Motus Vitae  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene),"The idea here is to present a more structured and sophisticated Brut with emphasis on the nutty tones and mature peach. The wine succeeds in this regard but the whole point of Prosecco is to be light and fun; this ultimately lacks those sharp, well-defined fruit tones you might expect.",87
,Bortolotti NV Brut  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene),"Here is a lighter, paler shade of Prosecco with opulent and cheerful soapy and herbal qualities (thanks to 10% Pinot Bianco) backed by lemon candy and polished mineral. Yellow apple and chalk are immediately recognizable. The mouthfeel is creamy and foamy with fresh crispness that is noticeable but not exaggerated.",87
,Castle 2005 Sangiacomo Vineyards Pinot Noir (Carneros),"There's a sweetmeat, salty leatheriness to this Pinot, like beef jerky. Give it a year or so to mellow out and let the smoky oak integrate with the ripe cherry, cola and raspberry flavors. Decant for an hour or two if you pop it open now.",87
Michael Schachner,Codorníu NV Reserva Raventós Brut Sparkling (Cava),"Ginger ale and Sprite are the first things that come to mind when you give it a sniff. The palate shows ripe and sweet orange, tangerine and pink grapefruit, while the back end is lean and citrusy but far short of complex. Good in a standard way.",87
,Ortman Family 2008 Turner Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"A bit heavy handed, with lots of tannins and acidity, and the jammy cherry-berry fruit is in your face. It's made in a big, bold style that will appeal to fruit-forward fans.",87
Lauren Buzzeo,Recanati 2009 Yasmin Kosher Red Red (Galilee),"Year after year, the Yasmin line from Recanati proves itself to be a fantastic value, and the 2009s are no exception. This 60% Merlot-40% Cabernet Sauvignon blend is fruit-driven but appropriately spiced with a lovely mocha-infused finish. The silky texture offers approachable, dusty tannins integrated throughout the medium-weight mouth.",87
,Tenuta di Vignole 2007  Chianti Classico,"Perfect for a pairing with lasagna or meat cannelloni with bechamel sauce, this bright Chianti Classico has the natural acidity to cut though fatty food ingredients. The wine's aromas recall white cherry and raspberry.",87
Paul Gregutt,Two Vintners 2007 Lola Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Lola is a 50-50 Cabernet Sauvignon/Syrah blend, smooth and supple, with a mix of purple berries, black cherry, cassis and smoke. The tannins finish a little green, and the Cab/Syrah combo seems to nullify the clear, varietal expression of either grape, but overall this is a well-crafted wine that could stand nicely alongside a hanger steak.",87
,X 2009 Truchard Vineyard Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Teeters on the verge of complexity, with dry, spicy flavors of raspberries and cherries. Good Carneros acidity makes for a brisk mouthfeel. Should develop for a year or three in the bottle.",87
Michael Schachner,Albet I Noya 2009 Petit Albet White (Penedès),"Minerally, dry and clean white wine made from 60% Xarello and 40% Chardonnay. The nose is peachy, while the palate is spritzy and bouncy, with short, slightly creamy apple, melon and papaya flavors that are true to Xarello. Finishes smooth but a little flat.",87
,Avignonesi 2008  Rosso di Montepulciano,"Avignonesi takes a traditionalists' approach to most of its wines, including this ruby-colored Rosso di Montepulciano. Slightly muddled aromas of cherry and dried raspberry mingle with tobacco, leather and spice.",87
Lauren Buzzeo,Binyamina 2009 Reserve Unoaked Kosher Chardonnay (Judean Hills),"Here's a fresh and lively unoaked Chard that's perfect for lighter fare like tabouleh salad or grilled chicken. Green apple and citrus mingle with a hint of lemon custard on the nose, while the medium-weight mouth offers more green plum and white nectarine flavors. Flavorful and refreshing; drink now.",87
Michael Schachner,Valserrano 2004  Rioja,"A snappy, high-acid wine that pulses with red fruit aromas and flavors. It's sheering, which is normal for the Graciano variety, but it also tastes nice while delivering a bolt of raspberry and red plum flavor. Oak comes up late, providing a counterweight of vanilla and dry spice. Nice but like all varietal Gracianos, it's sharp and limited.",87
Joe Czerwinski,Mt. Beautiful 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Canterbury),"A plump, nicely concentrated Sauvignon Blanc, the 2009 Mount Beautiful doesn't have the most intense aromatics, but is holding on to its weighty melon and fig flavors and lingering citrus finish. Drink up.",87
,Poggio Nardone 2008  Morellino di Scansano,"Sangiovese is enhanced by small percentages of Malvasia Nera and Colorino to deliver a plush, plump and satisfying Morellino from southern Tuscany. There's a nice feeling of informality here that makes this wine perfect for easy meals with family and friends.",87
Roger Voss,Château Ramafort 2008  Médoc,"At first taste, the tannins dominate. Then fresher fruit shows through. The wine is firmly dry, the texture linear, the fruit showing some black currant character.",87
Joe Czerwinski,Mana 2008 Pinot Noir (Marlborough),"Slightly more concentrated than other Marlborough Pinots in this price range, the 2008 Mana displays modest cherry fruit and an array of savory elements, including game, brine and peppery spice. It's a bit rough around the edges, yet in a charming sort of way. Drink now–2012.",87
,Drew 2009 Morning Dew Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Acidity marks this fresh, young Pinot Noir. It's as if the raspberry and cherry wine has been enlivened with a splash or three of lime juice. This primary fruit tartness may be because the wine was bottled and rushed to market too early. Don't drink it now. Give it a year or two to integrate.",87
,Giuliano Tiberi 2007 Le Vespe Sangiovese (Toscana),"Clove and dark Indian spice is the protagonist here and background aromas of cherry and moist earth play supporting roles. The wine is smooth and soft in the mouth with a bright, zesty close.",87
,Greater Purpose NV White Label Red (Dry Creek Valley),"Made from an unknown blend of grapes, this nonvintage red is good, dry and versatile. It has juicy flavors of blackberries and pepper, with some extra layers of depth that make it a good value for a restaurant by-the-glass wine.",87
Michael Schachner,Reina de Castilla 2009 Isabelino Verdejo-Viura (Rueda),"Maybe it's the Viura, becuase this $9 wine seems cleaner, rounder and slightly better than the winery's higher-priced pure Verdejos. Look for generic but fresh peach and citrus aromas and then lip-smacking citrus flavors. Finishes composed and clean, with lasting grapefruit flavor. 60% Verdejo and 40% Viura.",87
,Rocca delle Macìe 2007  Chianti Classico,"This is a classic interpretation of Chianti Classico with bright aromas of small berry fruit, raspberry and blue flower. But there's also a modern touch as well that comes off aromatically as spice and new leather.",87
Roger Voss,Joseph Drouhin 2012  Pouilly-Fuissé,"This wine is missing great depth of flavor. It has bright acidity and hints of peach fruit flavors, but remains dull.",84
Matt Kettmann,Vino Vargas 2013 Olé Chardonnay (Central Coast),"There's pineapple and sharp dill on the nose of this wine from a Gilroy-based producer. Once sipped, apple cider and a tinge of petrol flavors emerge.",84
Roger Voss,Demessey 2012 Château de Messey Les Crets  (Mâcon-Chardonnay),"This is a generous, rounded and very perfumed wine. Candy and bubble gum flavors give sweetness that contrasts with the acidity.",84
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Four Degrees of Riesling 2012 0 Degree Dry Riesling (Seneca Lake),"Faithful to its label, this zero-degree residual-sugar Riesling is stark, steely and intensely dry. Bracing lemon acidity and tart green-apple flavors lend a tight, unyielding feel to the palate, but it's a refreshing accompaniment to creamy pasta or chicken dishes. Drink now.",84
Roger Voss,Joseph Drouhin 2011  Chorey-lès-Beaune,"The wine is tight, green and herbal. It has some fruitiness, but that is suppressed by general underripeness. The tannins are hard at the end.",84
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Knapp 2013 Dry Rosé (Finger Lakes),"Dusty mineral and earth tones lend a savory feel to delicate cherry and red-plum flavors in this pale pink rosé. Bright, fresh raspberry-lemonade acidity bristles on the palate.",84
Kerin O’Keefe,Armosa 2008 Curma Nero d'Avola (Sicilia),"Funky aromas of farmyard, tire rubber and fetid flowers waft from the glass of this Nero d'Avola. The muddled palate offers stewed prune, overripe black plum and oaky vanilla alongside bitter, green sensations of old sage. Panebianco, Vinity.",84
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Fulkerson 2012 William Vigne Grüner Veltliner (Seneca Lake),"Aromas of pressed apple and pear are savory and earthy on this brisk, medium-bodied Grüner Veltliner. There's a dusty minerality that lingers through the midpalate, but the finish is bright and lemony.",84
Jim Gordon,Stomping Ground 2012 Chardonnay (California),"Pleasant and fruity to sip, soft in texture, light- to medium bodied, it has a rich yellow-gold color, butter-candy aromas, ripe apple flavors and a slightly sweet finish.",84
Joe Czerwinski,L. Tramier & Fils 2012 Linteau Red (Côtes du Rhône),"This blend of 70% Grenache and 30% Syrah is a chunky, slightly rustic style of Côtes-du-Rhône. It starts off with tar and herb aromas, then turns plummy and chocolaty on the palate. Drink now–2017.",84
Michael Schachner,Lo Nuevo 2012 Covello Albariño (Rías Baixas),"Peach and apple aromas are fruity but not precise or minerally. This has peachy acidity but a wide, unfocused palate. Flavors of peach and nectarine are tasty but lack the crispness that Albariño is known for.",84
Roger Voss,Pierre André 2011  Ladoix,"This tight wine has red fruit acidity without the richness. With its green edge, it's likely to remain full of acidity even as it matures.",84
Mike DeSimone,Suvla 2012 Kinali Yapincak (Thrace),"Made of Kinali Yapincak, a grape native to Turkey, this deep-straw colored wine does not give up much on the nose beyond a touch of apricot and just-washed cotton sheets. It does not seem wholly integrated on the palate, with chewy tannins overpowering flavors of melon, toast and white flower.",84
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Swedish Hill 2012 Reserve Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),Pressed apple notes are touched with butter and creamed corn on this savory-style Chardonnay. It's rich and full on the palate with a satisfying silkiness that's brightened with lemony acidity.,84
Roger Voss,Chanson Père et Fils 2012  Viré-Clessé,"The green fruit flavors dominate this very fresh, crisp wine. It has acidity as much as fruitiness, giving a steely, tight character. Drink now.",84
Michael Schachner,Coto de Hayas 2013 Chardonnay (Campo de Borja),Mild aromas of apple and generic white fruits are friendly enough. This has a monotone citrusy mouthfeel and flavors of tangerine and grapefruit. A bit of stalky corn and hay flavor rises up on the finish.,84
Roger Voss,Demessey 2011 Les Hâtes  (Santenay),"A firm wine that is mainly tannin without a great fruit element. It is dry, tight and hard-edged.",84
Roger Voss,Jean-Marie Challand 2012 Vieilles Vignes  (Viré-Clessé),"Tropical in character, this wine has soft acidity and an attractive texture. With ripe mango flavor, it's full in the mouth and ready to drink.",84
Roger Voss,Domaine Sophie Cinier 2012  Mâcon-Fuissé,"Burnt caramel aromas give a wine that has weight, sweetness and packs in the vanilla. It misses out on real fruitiness, giving weight rather than freshness.",84
Matt Kettmann,Fazeli Cellars 2009 Khayyam Cabernet Sauvignon (Temecula Valley),"Complicated, at times confusingly dank aromas of mushrooms, hops, dill and other wet herbs emerge from this bottling. Those atypical varietal characters find their way onto the palate as well, with olive and stewed mushrooms leading the way.",84
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Four Degrees of Riesling 2012 2nd Degree Medium Sweet Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Lush and tropical with rich, ripe streaks of pineapple and mango, this medium-sweet Riesling is unabashedly forward and fruity, but hints of earth and dust on the midpalate lend a dark tone. Light on its feet, with a lemony finish.",84
Roger Voss,Pierre André 2012  Saint-Véran,"Tight, acidic and very crisp, it's propelled forward by lemon zest and grapefruit flavors. It is bright, fruity and light in texture.",84
Roger Voss,Jean-Marie Challand 2012 Les Tilles  (Mâcon-Villages),"This soft, open wine has a light fruit character with attractive acidity and a crisp aftertaste. Drink now.",84
Roger Voss,Joseph Burrier 2012 Château de Beauregard  (Saint-Véran),"A vegetal wine that has acidity and rhubarb flavors. It is tight and full of acidity, with a very citrusy aftertaste. Drink now.",84
Anna Lee C. Iijima,King's Garden Vineyards 2010 Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes),"While pulpy and ripe on the nose with aromas of blackberry and cherry compote, this Cabernet Franc runs towards the savory side on the palate. Bold in body and alcohol, it's rich with red fruit, but has a musty, earthen tone that persists through the finish.",84
Virginie Boone,Laird 2011 Jillian's Blend Red (Napa Valley),"Dusty in tannins and planky in wood, this chewy red blends Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Merlot and Malbec into a mouthful of black olive, black currant and leather.",84
Anna Lee C. Iijima,McGregor 2010 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Finger Lakes),"Scents of fresh red cherries and bramble wood entice on the nose of this aromatic, spice-toned Cabernet Sauvignon. The palate, while crisp with cranberry acidity, is a bit subdued with subtle red-fruit flavor and a finish that wraps up short and tight.",84
Michael Schachner,Bodegas Valdemar 2010 Conde de Valdemar Old Vines  (Rioja),"Raisiny, pruny aromas are all that register on this rubbery, jammy Garnacha. Flavors of sweet plum, raspberry and raisin are chunky, while the finish is raisiny in flavor and rubbery in feel.",84
Michael Schachner,Protos 2011 Reserva  (Ribera del Duero),"Gritty, intense, oaky and powerful from start to finish, this displays black-fruit aromas, hints of asphalt and an intense mouthfeel with a tight grip. A common duo of black-fruit and oaky flavors finishes with vanilla notes and a hint of coconut. Drink this structured, fully tannic RDD through 2028.",92
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Schloss Vollrads 2015 Spätlese Riesling (Rheingau),"Electric lemon-lime acidity reverberates throughout this light-bodied Riesling. The palate is fruity, pulsing with sweet, fresh peach, apricot and tangerine flavors. The finish lingers on a delicately lacy sweetness.",92
Virginie Boone,Sojourn 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"This hails from a 1,000–1,400-foot elevation site above the valley floor called Oakville Ranch that contributes beautiful power in its firm, integrated tannin and oak. Balanced, the wine exudes lovely notes of boysenberry tart, blackberry and cedar, with a dusting of clove.",92
Virginie Boone,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 2013 Cask 23 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is a rich, peppery and generously tannic and full-bodied expression of the grape, both powerful and brimming in grace. Soft and mellow on the midpalate, it builds up ripeness and texture toward the finish, ending with a satisfying bite of graham cracker and chocolate.",92
Joe Czerwinski,Thorn Clarke 2014 Eden Trail Riesling (Eden Valley),"Lean, tight and austere, this textbook Eden Valley Riesling should develop well over the next 5–8 years, reaching maturity around 2022. Scents of petrichor and tangerine ease into tart lemon-lime notes on the palate, ending tart and mouthpuckering.",92
Jim Gordon,Aratás 2011 Shake Ridge Ranch Petite Sirah (Amador County),"This full-bodied wine has a big impact on the palate due to smoky, meaty flavors, very firm tannins and an overall huge personality. It starts with aromas of charcoal and charred oak, goes to ripe, rich but not sweet fruit flavors, and finishes with all that grip as well as lingering smoky nuances.",92
Roger Voss,Santos & Seixo 2013 Santos da Casa Grande Reserva Red (Douro),"This wine has fine tannins, ripe berry fruits and well-integrated acidity. Rich and juicy, it offers blackberry flavors and a crisp aftertaste. Drink this wine, part of a range of wines from across Portugal, from 2018.",92
Jim Gordon,Spicy Vines 2014 Joie de Vivre Chardonnay (Mendocino Ridge),"Subtle, well-balanced and rich in texture, this full-bodied wine sneaks up on the taste buds, starting with mild Bosc pear and toasted-almond aromas, then pouring richer pear, honey and hazelnut flavors onto the palate. A slight reserve in the flavors is more than offset by a quiet complexity and lingering finish.",92
Jim Gordon,Terra d'Oro 2014 Teroldego (Amador County),"Super-concentrated and intense, this starts with a very deep color and aromas like espresso and smoked meat. Flavors suggest black cherry and cranberry shaded with spices. An earthy, savory thread runs through all the dark fruit and spices, lingering on the finish.",92
Paul Gregutt,The Eyrie Vineyards 2015 Original Vines Pinot Gris (Dundee Hills),"Planted in 1965, these are the oldest examples of this variety in the country. Jason Lett showcases this special fruit in this natural wine with no sulfites added and no cold stabilization. Light gold in color, the crisp apple flavors are forward, the balance is spot on and the finish polished. Drink now through 2020.",92
Virginie Boone,Tongue Dancer 2014 Putnam Vineyard Pinot de Ville Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"In this inaugural release, winemaker James MacPhail travels to the far reaches of Annapolis to source grapes from the true wilderness, the site next door to Goldrock Ridge Vineyard. Made in a full-bodied style, this wine is intriguing in dried herb, black pepper and forest floor, with a healthy, lengthy seasoning of savory black tea.",92
Jim Gordon,Uvaggio 2015 Secco Moscato (Lodi),"This bone-dry and floral wine will taste great with simple appetizers like toasted nuts or fresh cheeses. It is very well concentrated and has medium to full body. An opulent texture helps carry the floral, appley, grapefruity flavors into the finish.",92
Paul Gregutt,WillaKenzie Estate 2014 Triple Black Slopes Pinot Noir,"A slightly bitter tobacco note frames black-cherry fruit. The tannins need more time to smooth out, and that bitter streak is a bit worrisome. But that said, this powerful deep compact wine may explode with flavor if you have the patience to cellar it. Drink after 2020.",92
Paul Gregutt,WillaKenzie Estate 2015 Estate Grown Pinot Blanc,"This thoroughly delightful wine puts a polished sheen on this grape, that is so often lost in the shuffle between Pinot Gris and Chardonnay. Here the clean and fresh flavors of grapefruit, white peach and melon mingle gracefully, with palate-pleasing texture and zippy acidity.",92
Virginie Boone,William Harrison 2014 Sangiacomo Family Vineyards Chardonnay (Carneros),"With a pronounced sensibility of caramelized apple and toasted brioche, this wine opens with a memorable lushness and richness that finds its balance in stony minerality. The highlights of flavor lean into golden pear compote and lemon zest, with a delicate seasoning of ginger.",92
Roger Voss,Yohan Lardy 2015 Le Vivier  (Fleurie),"This is a beautifully perfumed wine, ripe with black fruits and generous with its tannins and acidity. It comes from a one-acre parcel called Le Vivier which has 70-year-old vines. It is concentrated, dense and with aging potential. Drink from 2018.",92
Sean P. Sullivan,Avennia 2014 Arnaut Boushey Vineyard Syrah (Yakima Valley),"Coming from one of the state's most esteemed Syrah vineyards, this wine wins over fans by its brains rather than its brawn. High-toned aromas of dried herbs mix with notes of raspberry, blue fruit and iron. The flavors are fresh and layered, bringing a sense of vibrancy and deliciousness.",92
Jim Gordon,Bella 2013 Big River Ranch Vineyard Series Zinfandel (Alexander Valley),"From century-old vines, this wine is potent and focused, with powerful, ripe fruit flavors and a texture that feels polished and precise. The aromas favor black cherry and black pepper, the flavors are fresh and mouth-filling, and the wine has firm acidity and tannins that make the texture appetizing.",92
Sean P. Sullivan,Brian Carter Cellars 2012 Solesce Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The winery's flagship wine, Cabernet Sauvignon makes up just over half, with the balance Merlot, Petit Verdot, Malbec and Cabernet Franc. Despite its age, it starts tight as a drum, with light aromas of spice, dark cherry, coffee and dried flowers. It's full flavored, with a dazzling richness to the textured fruit and barrel notes. Best after 2021.",92
Roger Voss,Bulas 2010 Grande Reserva Red (Douro),"A blend from two vineyards, this wine is rich and full bodied, with fine tannins and a dark concentration. With its perfumed character and tight structure, it is impressive, full of black fruits with a strong mineral streak. Drink this still-young wine from 2019.",92
Sean P. Sullivan,Cadaretta 2013 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Though labeled as a Syrah, this drinks more like a GSM, with 11% Mourvèdre, 5% Grenache and 2% Viognier contributing prominently to the blend. Aromas of cocoa, orange peel, coffee grounds, raspberry and dark fruit are followed by full-bodied fruit and barrel flavors.",92
Paul Gregutt,Raptor Ridge 2015 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"A pretty light gold hue, this wine shines brightly from the first sniff to the last sip. It's clean and dense, with notes of bee pollen and lemon oil, flavors of apple and pear, and a touch of vanilla cookie.",92
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Dr. Heidemanns-Bergweiler 2015 Bernkasteler Badstube Auslese Riesling (Mosel),"Dusty minerals, pollen and spice notes lend complexity to this honey-toned auslese. The palate is decadently sweet, glazed in caramelized sugar and heaving with ripe cantaloupe and peach flavors. A bite of lemon-lime acidity offsets all the opulence, lending edge to a long, lingering finish.",92
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Dr. Loosen 2012 Ürziger Würzgarten GG Réserve Alte Reben Erste Lage Dry Riesling (Mosel),"Layers of exotic spice and crushed earth permeate through this dry Riesling paying just homage to it's red-clay origins in Ürziger Würzgarten, the spice garden of the Mosel. It's exquisitely light bodied, a revitalizing crush of cutting white grapefruit and lime flavors. The finish is marked by a meandering spray of spice and honey. Drinks well now but should improve through at least 2030.",92
Jim Gordon,Meyer Family Cellars 2012 Petite Sirah (Yorkville Highlands),"Big and bold in character, this full-bodied and abundantly tannic wine looks black to the rim and smells like pencil shavings, leather and wood smoke. The flavors are dry but enticing, with dark chocolate, charred beef and black cherry. It needs until at least 2022 to peak.",92
Paul Gregutt,Ovum 2015 Memorista Tradition Riesling (Eola-Amity Hills),"From a different block of the same vineyard as the “Whale label” Memorista, this is drinking much better at the moment. It's smooth and supple—a pretty wine with honeyed minerality around fruit flavors of citrus and peaches.",92
Michael Schachner,Perelada 2012 Finca Malaveïna Red (Empordà),"This five-grape blend is muscular and wide on the palate, with oaky berry flavors that are also tarry and toasty. Hard tannins and some chop on the finish suggest further aging would be beneficial. Drink this Cabernet-led blend that also includes Garnacha, Syrah, Merlot and Cab Franc through 2025.",92
Sean P. Sullivan,Proper 2014 Estate Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"The aromas jump up, with mesmerizing notes of fresh herbs, green olive, violets, orange peel, smoked meat and huckleberry. The palate shows a light but pillowy texture alongside flavors that carry on the finish. It's all about subtlety.",92
Roger Voss,Quinta da Zaralhôa 2008 Reserva Red (Douro),"Produced in the Douro Superior region in the far east of the Douro Valley, this wine is dense with tarry tannins and black fruits. Wood aging and the concentration of old vines make it impressive. Drink now until 2022.",92
Roger Voss,Ramos-Pinto 2014 Duas Quintas Reserva Red (Douro),"The Reserve version of this brand, this young wine is ripe and firm, with great potential. The Duas Quintas (two estates) are Ervamoira and Bons Ares, both in the Douro Superior. With attractive smoky flavors and ripe red-berry fruits it will become a rich wine. Drink from 2020.",92
Alexander Peartree,Wyncroft 2013 Wren Song Riesling (Lake Michigan Shore),"Lemon pith and ripe peach aromas are clouded under a distinctly medicinal tone of baby aspirin. While there is nice roundness to the palate and balanced acidity to boot, the flavors are mild showings of orchard fruit and lemon curd.",84
Michael Schachner,Vicente Gandia 2014 Hoya de Cadenas Organic Verdejo (Spain),"Lightly floral aromas are dilute while hinting at quince jelly. There's not a lot of vitality to the palate, while tangerine and nectarine flavors are watery. Pithy citrus notes carry the finish before it putters out.",84
Michael Schachner,Casa Montes 2014 Ampakama Chardonnay (San Juan),"Tropical aromas revolve around lemon-lime. This is acidic without much body. Flavors of lemon, melon, mango and green apple are lean and finish with tangy, pithy citrus flavors.",84
Michael Schachner,Albet I Noya 2014 XA Xarel-lo (Penedès),"Bland aromas suggest applesauce. This varietal Xarello feels plump but flat. Candied, generic white-fruit flavors are nonspecific, while this offers up citrus notes and pyrazines on the finish.",84
Virginie Boone,Gustafson Family 2012 Mountain Cuvée Estate Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"From the producer's Old Vineyard Block, and blended with 20% Petite Sirah and 5% Syrah, this wine has a rustic barnyardy quality. It offers a tightness of dried herb around broad, sweet tannins, strawberry jam and chocolate.",84
Virginie Boone,JAQK Cellars 2013 High Roller Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Meant to provide value, this wine also offers big oak, smoke and a bittersweet taste of black-tea tannins. Shy in fruit, this has a slightly reduced effect on the finish.",84
Virginie Boone,Gracianna 2014 Suzanne's Blend Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Apple skin and guava rise out from a more buttery aroma that leads to oak on the palate. Light bodied, the wine finishes tart in lemon and lime.",84
Michael Schachner,Angulo Innocenti 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (La Consulta),"Leafy, green aromas suggest eucalyptus and a briar patch. A lean palate offers aroma-matching flavors of green herbs along with plum, cherry and clay notes. This is oaky and resiny tasting on the finish, and hot as well.",84
Jim Gordon,Cable Car 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi),"This is on the light side, with simple flavors and a juicy, soft texture that shows very little tannin. Aromas and flavors recall cherries and strawberries.",84
Virginie Boone,Michael-Scott 2013 Zinfandel (Napa County-Sonoma County),"Pruney and somewhat reduced, this thick offering of chocolate and blackberry jam needs food to mellow it out, preferably meat covered thickly in sauce.",84
Michael Schachner,Luis Segundo Correas 2013 Valle Las Acequias Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),"Wiry, briary currant and herbal aromas announce a hard but juicy wine with buttery oak, salty red fruit flavors and a loud herbal angle. This is both briny tasting and a touch weedy on the finish.",84
Roger Voss,Parras Vinhos 2014 Montaria Tinto Red (Alentejano),"This is a rich, full wine that has red fruits and soft tannins. With balanced acidity, only a hint of tannins, it is ready to drink.",84
Roger Voss,Quinta do Casal Branco 2014 Quartilho Branco White (Tejo),"This is a gentle, ripe wine that has pineapple and peach flavors and fresh fruitiness. It is smooth with balanced acidity and a zesty aftertaste. Drink now.",84
Roger Voss,Quinta do Casal Monteiro 2015 White (Tejo),"A young, fresh blend of Arinto and Fernão Pires, the wine is fruity, light and with a crisp, bright aftertaste. Drink now.",84
Paul Gregutt,Schmidt 2012 Pinot Noir (Applegate Valley),"Somewhat disjointed flavors mix subtle red fruits with cracker, licorice and coffee. So far the components have not smoothed out. It's a flavor jumble.",84
Alexander Peartree,Three Fires 2013 Unoaked Chardonnay (Lake Michigan Shore),Faint notes of yuzu rise over underripe peach in this unoaked Chardonnay. The light-bodied palate shows a mild concentration of lemon leading to a short but clean finish.,84
Alexander Peartree,Verterra 2014 Dry Gewurztraminer (Leelanau Peninsula),"Muddled aromas of tangerine, grapefruit and papaya seem a bit soapy in character. The palate feels a bit underripe, showing milky florals upfront and unconcentrated citrus on the back.",84
Roger Voss,Wine with Spirit 2013 Bastardo! Black Edition Tinto Red (Tejo),"The wine is fresh with red berry flavors and a stalky tannic core. It's lightly perfumed, light in texture and ready to drink.",84
Roger Voss,Wine with Spirit 2014 Seafood & Co White (Vinho Verde),"There is an attractive, light prickle on the tongue of this fresh, crisp and fruity wine. It is dry, tensely tangy with a green, zesty character. Drink now.",84
Michael Schachner,Finca Salazar 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),Oily aromas of orange peel are inoffensive. A shearing palate offers little textural pleasure or complexity. Flavors of lemon and blood orange finish with a sour note of underripe pineapple.,83
Virginie Boone,Buena Vista 2013 Private Reserve Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"This somewhat indistinctive wine has a wealth of minty aroma on the nose, a characteristic that doesn't shake off on the palate, the body full and a touch hot.",83
Michael Schachner,Pazo de Barrantes 2012 La Comtesse Albariño (Rías Baixas),"Yeasty aromas are devoid of fruit, commitment and minerality, and instead smell oddly floral and unconvincing. A waxy, wan palate and oaky flavors of clove finish with resiny, pushy spice notes. This tastes overly oaky and resiny, like the winery's Rioja white called La Capellanía but without the goods.",83
Roger Voss,Cooperativa Reguengos de Monsaraz 2014 Monsaraz Branco White (Alentejo),"The wine is fruity, although with a yeasty character that leaves a bready taste. It has acidity, ripe yellow fruits and the fruitiness may come to dominate although that is not certain.",83
Virginie Boone,Armanino Family Cellars 2013 The Pintail Pinot Noir (Napa Valley),"There's something mushroomy and feral about this wine, which finishes with sour cherry.",83
Roger Voss,Parras Vinhos 2014 Castelo do Sulco Colheita White (Lisboa),"A blend of Moscatel and Arinto, this is light and thin with only the vaguest hint of citrus fruit acidity. It should be drunk now.",83
Kerin O’Keefe,Lechthaler 2014 Drago Pinot Grigio (Trentino),"The nose isn't very expressive but you can detect whiffs of adhesive bandage, medicinal herb, apple skin and mineral that carry over to the diluted, rather bitter palate. Brisk acidity underscores the wine's lean character.",83
Jim Gordon,Coast 2013 Chardonnay (California),"While very flavorful, this wine is more of a dessert drink than a lunch or dinner wine. It smells sweet and earthy, feels unctous and tastes sweet, especially on the finish.",83
Michael Schachner,Pagos del Rey 2014 Altos de Tamaron  (Ribera del Duero),"Candied raspberry aromas and a racy, acidic, crisp feel tell you what's coming: pie-cherry tartness and then a sizzle-and-pop finish that's fresh but astringent.",83
Jim Gordon,Pat Paulsen Vineyards 2013 England-Shaw Vienyard Syrah (Solano County),"Balsamic aromas and strong pruney flavors combine for a heavy-handed taste in this full-bodied wine. It seems to be well-aged already, so drink it soon if you like this style.",83
Virginie Boone,Mossback 2013 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Earthy and stemmy in dark black fruit, this wine contains 2% Syrah from Dunnigan Hills, though it's unclear how that contributes. Thin on the palate, it has a medicinal, minty flourish on the finish.",83
Matt Kettmann,Peachy Canyon 2012 Especial Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"Aromas of blueberries, beef roast and fudge give way to a light, straightforward palate of purple fruit. It's a clean wine, but not very complex.",86
Roger Voss,Quinta de Porrais 2012 Porrais Red (Douro),Rustic aromas are followed by rough-edged fruitiness in this young wine. It has ripe berry fruits as well as some firm tannins in the background. It is not yet integrated and needs to develop much more. Drink from 2018.,86
Roger Voss,Quintas de Melgaço 2014 QM Terra Antiga White (Vinho Verde),"This light, bright wine comes from the north of the Vinho Verde region. It has freshly squeezed lemon juice with a touch of lime zest as well as spice. The lightest prickle on the tongue gives the wine a final lift.",86
Michael Schachner,Tricky Rabbit 2012 Reserva Cabernet Franc-Carmenère (Maule Valley),"Chunky, slightly jammy plum and blackberry aromas are good but basic. In the mouth, this shows tartaric grit and bite along with lean fruit. Flavors of red plum and raspberry finish zesty but with hardly any complexity.",86
Virginie Boone,Bradford Mountain 2012 Grist Vineyard Syrah (Dry Creek Valley),"This wine also contains 25% Zinfandel and is wildly savage in herb, baked plum jam, tobacco and a strong arm of oak. Midpalate, it takes on more savory peppercorn and herb over fruit, finishing mildly.",86
Matt Kettmann,Consilience 2012 Petite Sirah (Santa Barbara County),"There's a slightly reductive quality on the nose of this wine, with rubber, tar, dill and hot lava rock notes. The palate shows roast beef char, sour cherry fruits and asphalt.",86
Roger Voss,Domaine de la Pepière 2009 Cuvée 3  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine),"A blend of two different vineyards, this ripe wine is now very mature. It has lost its primary fruitiness and developed toasty spice as well as a more funky, earthy character.",86
Roger Voss,Falua 2013 Tagus Creek Tinto Red (Alentejano),"In this blend of Shiraz and Trincadeira, both grapes contribute red fruits, soft tannins and fresh-faced acidity. With no complications—just bright, juicy fruit—the wine is ready to drink.",86
Roger Voss,Quinta da Rede 2013 Rede Branco White (Douro),"Both mineral and herbaceous, this is a crisp, taut and textured wine. It shows a tangy character, lemon zest and bright acidity. It's still too young, so drink from the end of 2015.",86
Paul Gregutt,Reustle 2013 Winemaker's Reserve Pinot Noir (Umpqua Valley),"Similar to the winery's regular Pinot Noir, this is moving quickly along the aging curve. Hints of strawberry fruit are cloaked in barrel flavors of mocha and cracker. Drink soon.",86
Virginie Boone,Silverado 2011 Estate Grown Mt. George Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley),"Red plum compote is at the center of this wine, a 100% varietal, with hearty bursts of herb and green pepper, as well as savory spice. From the cooler Coombsville appellation, it is soft, round and on the paler, thinner side of Napa's ripeness spectrum, more restrained.",86
Virginie Boone,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 2013 Aveta Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"The inaugural vintage of this wine, named for a water goddess, this offers herb, grass, lemon and peach around a medium body influenced by some oak. As it develops in the glass, tropical fruit unfurls in a refreshing spritz before settling down to a tart finish.",86
Roger Voss,Yohan Lardy 2015 Les Michelons  (Moulin-à-Vent),"The wine is still young with its crisp red fruits and tense tannins. It is a structured wine, firm with a dry core and still developing its fruitiness. It will need to age a while yet, so drink from 2018.",88
Sean P. Sullivan,Analemma 2014 Atavus Vineyard Gewürztraminer (Columbia Gorge (WA)),"The aromas are light, with notes of freshly cut apple and spice. It drinks dry with elegantly styled fruit flavors that linger on the finish. It shows a very pretty styling.",88
Paul Gregutt,Argyle 2014 Nuthouse Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"Light strawberry fruit with tart acidity carries a wine of modest proportions. It's drinking well, and might be a good choice for a simple salmon preparation, as it would not overwhelm the fish. The finishing tannins have a definite herbal flavor.",88
Michael Schachner,Chopo 2014 Monastrell-Syrah (Jumilla),"Jammy plum and berry aromas come with dessert herb scents. A juicy palate doesn't offer much structure, but this Monastrell-Syrah blend tastes good courtesy of plum, blackberry and toasty flavors. The ripe warm finish is generous.",88
Jim Gordon,Meyer Family Cellars 2013 Syrah (Yorkville Highlands),"Smooth and polished, this medium-bodied wine has attractive fruit and cinnamon aromas, generous dark-fruit flavors, and light touches of baking spices.",88
Sean P. Sullivan,Milbrandt 2012 Vineyard Series Clifton Vineyards Grenache (Wahluke Slope),Aromas of vanilla and cocoa mix with red fruit. The fruit flavors are full and palate coating but the oak seems a little too intense at times.,88
Matt Kettmann,MooBuzz 2015 G-S-M (Central Coast),"Hibiscus and strawberry scents make an appealing invitation on the nose of this bottling, and then light cola and pepper spice up the ante. This would be a great red for warmer weather, served with a slight chill that would still allow the flavors of sandalwood, red cherry and marjoram to emerge.",88
Matt Kettmann,Opolo 2012 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"Though a reserve bottling, this shows a very fresh and sprightly side of the grape rather than its dense face. Squeezed blackberries, just-picked thyme and a touch of burnt caramel show on the nose, while the palate offers Concord grape, boysenberry and iced-coffee flavors.",88
Michael Schachner,Palma Real 2015 Verdejo-Viura (Rueda),"Melon, nectarine and mild citrus aromas are clean and direct. This basic white is firm and balanced, while stone fruit, melon and white-pepper flavors end easy and fresh.",88
Roger Voss,Parras Wines 2015 Evidência Red (Dão),"This structured wine has a strong mineral element. With black-currant and berry flavors, it is firm and still young. Swathes of rich fruit are sustained by solid tannins. Drink from late 2017.",88
Matt Kettmann,Proulx 2014 The Wah Syrah (Paso Robles),"Candied black cherry and fresh boysenberry aromas meet with darker touches of soy, teriyaki and burnt caramel on the nose of this bottling. The palate is mineral-driven, with light tar, asphalt and peppercorn flavors leading into dusty elderberry fruit.",88
Roger Voss,Quinta do Vale Meão 2014 Meandro do Vale Meão Red (Douro),"The second wine of Vale Meão, this is rich and fruity. It has enough structure to allow it to develop while also having plenty of red-berry fruits and soft tannins. Give this wine until 2019.",88
Roger Voss,Quinta Dona Matilde 2013 Dona Matilde Reserva Red (Douro),Red-berry fruits and soft tannins give a wine with some juicy acidity and spice. The firm aftertaste shows that it is still needs time. Drink from 2018.,88
Roger Voss,Quinta dos Poços 2013 Reserva Red (Douro),Spice from wood aging is the initial character of this wine. Then the fruit comes through more strongly to give the wine richness and structure. Drink from 2018.,88
Virginie Boone,Robert Mondavi 2014 Reserve Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Aromatics of rose and mint give this wine prettiness on the nose before getting into darker, richer components on the palate. Medium in build, it retains a sizable tannin presence in its youth, complemented by dark cherry and a char on the oak.",88
Paul Gregutt,Roco 2014 Gravel Road Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"A mix of clones and vineyard sources, this is a bit rough and tumble, as the name might suggest. Hard cherry candy carries a touch of rubber, and some rugged tannins. That said, it's got plenty of punch and power.",88
Kerin O’Keefe,Tenuta Duecorti 2012 Castelletto  (Barolo),"Earthy nose of dried underbrush, truffle and scorched soil give way to cranberry and sour cherry flavors. Dried herb and dark spice add some depth while tightly packed astringent tannins leave a mouth-puckering finish. It's rather straightforward but let the tannins relax for another few years then drink.",88
Kerin O’Keefe,Podere ai Valloni 2014 Gratus Bio Red (Colline Novaresi),"A blend of 85% Nebbiolo and 15% Uva Rara, this fragrant red boasts alluring scents of pressed rose, moist earth, aromatic herb and whiff of exotic spice. The racy straightforward palate doles out tart red cherry, star anise and a hint of clove alongside fine-grained tannins and firm acidity.",88
Jim Gordon,Jamieson Ranch 2014 Whiplash Malbec (California),"This is a very good, medium-bodied wine. It has lightly oaky aromas, lots of fruit flavor, a smooth texture and an almost-sweet finish.",88
Jim Gordon,Leaping Lizard 2014 Merlot (California),"This is a light-bodied and full-flavored wine with a good, gripping texture and plenty of ripe plum and black pepper aromas. A fruity and beefy flavor carries through the finish.",88
Joe Czerwinski,Wirra Wirra 2015 Scrubby Rise White (Adelaide),"An innovative blend of Sauvignon Blanc (53%), Semillon (37%) and Viognier (10%), this medium-bodied wine delivers a mix of figs and melons, underscored by a silky texture. Ready to drink.",88
Michael Schachner,Zolo 2015 Sustainably Farmed Estate Grown and Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),"Cola, plum and red-currant aromas set up a tight palate with clamping tannins. Flavors of black cherry, cassis, plum and chocolate are lasting across the finish. This needs hearty food, additional airing or both to show its best.",88
Jim Gordon,Greystone Cellars 2014 Petite Sirah (California),"Heady aromas like wood smoke, black pepper and new rubber tire lead to equally peppery, smoky flavors and a firm, nicely tannic texture. The wine is medium to full bodied and well concentrated.",88
Joe Czerwinski,Hill-Smith Estate 2014 Chardonnay (Adelaide Hills),"This hand-picked, wild-fermented Chardonnay offers a lot to like. Notes of toasted grain, ripe pear and melon create a balanced blend of citrusy fruit and oaky spice, while the refreshing pineapple and clove notes linger on the finish.",88
Virginie Boone,Balletto 2015 Estate Grown Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),"From a relatively cool site for the variety, this white shows an abundance of green olive and Meyer lemon. Moderate body and acidity allow for a touch of lemongrass spiciness and black licorice amid the textured mouthfeel and length.",88
Michael Schachner,Cadus 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Agrelo),"Aromas of prune, blackberry, lemon peel and shoe polish are dark and earthy. This feels full and chewy, with hard tannins. Dark toasty black-fruit flavors come with herbal notes and wood spice flavors, while this tastes herbal, oaky, minty and like clove on the finish.",88
Michael Schachner,Cadus 2014 Gualtallary Malbec (Mendoza),"Odd aromas of curried meat and iodine are more unusual than off-putting. This feels a bit wide and heavy, with flatness to the palate. Flavors of roasted plum and savory spices suggest lamb curry, while this feels robust and aggressive on a slightly hot finish.",88
Jim Gordon,Casto Oaks 2014 Syrah (Sierra Foothills),"This very focused wine is deeply colored, has smoky, meaty aromas and concentrated fruit flavors. It is full bodied, firm and moderately tannic in texture.",88
Joe Czerwinski,Riposte 2015 The Dagger Pinot Noir (Adelaide Hills),"Pretty aromas of cherry and plum blossoms give way to fully ripe, slightly confectionary fruit, backed by hints of mocha. This medium-bodied Pinot Noir is supple in texture and softly dusty on the finish, making it an easy one to drink over the next couple of years.",88
Jim Gordon,Spann Vineyards 2015 Betsy's Backacher White (California),"Nuances of vanilla and toasted baguette add flair to this full-bodied and textural wine. It has straightforward crisp apple and grapefruit flavors, a dry balance, and a taut, almost astringent finish.",88
Paul Gregutt,Siduri 2008 Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),This California-made Oregon Pinot captures a sense of the particular terroir of Chehalem Mountains fruit. Wild strawberries are laced with peppery spice and a streak of cola. Good penetration and texture.,88
Susan Kostrzewa,Thema 2006 Red (Drama),"Full-bodied aromas of vanilla, ripe blackberry, spice and cinnamon lead this assertive red from Drama. Rich, spicy and savory on the palate, the wine has a nice balance of minerality and layered fruit. The finish has a smoky spin.",88
,Moletto 2001 Colmello Rosso Red (Veneto Orientale),Here's a blend of Merlot and Franconia (aged 48 months in oak) with straightforward aromas of cherry fruit and underbrush. The wine is smooth and offers slight sweetness followed by some sour notes on the close.,88
Joe Czerwinski,Domaine de Gournier 2008 Viognier (Vin de Pays des Cévennes),"It's said that Viognier is difficult to grow, but then how can bargains such as this continue to exist? For $10, you get truffled pear aromas rounded out by the addition of melon, decent concentration and a long, dusty-minerally finish. Drink now.",88
,Fratelli Berlucchi 2005 Brut Rosé Millesimato Sparkling (Franciacorta),"Beautifully pale pink in color with delicate shadings of peach and copper, this is an extremely elegant rosé sparkler from the Franciacorta area of northern Italy. The aromas are simple and straightforward, focusing on rose petal, cranberry and peach. The mouthfeel is crisp and easy.",88
,Hahn Estates 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Coast),"Here's a really good value in a dry, full-bodied Cabernet Sauvignon. It's filled with varietal flavors of blackberries and black currants, with a long, sweet finish. The tannins are sturdy and ripe. Fully ready now.",88
Roger Voss,Herdade da Malhadinha Nova 2008 Monte da Peceguina Tinto Red (Alentejano),"A broad, welcoming wine, the second label from Malhadinha Nova. It has spiced acidity, flavors of plums, licorice, with cranberry juice tannins. The flavors are big and bold, nothing held back.",88
,Hunt Cellars 2004 Maestro Red (Paso Robles),"A robust, softly tannic and powerfully ripe wine showing flavors of cherry pie filling, cola, raisins, red licorice and dusty Asian spices. This dry Bordeaux-style blend contains some Petite Sirah, and is at its best now–2012.",88
,Kings Mountain 2006 Meritage (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Rather tough and gritty now, this bone dry wine offers herb, tobacco and cedar flavors, with suggestions of cherries and currants. It's the answer to folks who complain that California Cabernets are fruit and oak bombs. Could surprise with 5–7 years in the bottle.",88
,Vinchio-Vaglio Serra 2003 Cantina Tre Serre  (Barbaresco),"Cheerful and bright, this well-priced wine offers a great introduction to Barbaresco to those who might be less familiar with this noble Italian wine. Vibrant aromas include wild berries, cola and a touch of smoked ham. The mouthfeel is crisp and very clean despite the hot vintage.",88
Michael Schachner,Marqués de Vargas 2005 Reserva Privada  (Rioja),"Dry, minty and saucy on the nose, with an old-school sheer palate full of acidity, citrus, cherry tomato, herbs and snap. Shows toasty oak, length and cheeky tannins along with red fruit finishing notes. In between new wave and traditional Rioja. Drink now through 2012.",88
Joe Czerwinski,Marrenon 2008 Grand Cuvée White (Luberon),"This barrel-fermented blend of Grenache Blanc, Vermentino and Roussanne features hints of toasted hazelnuts, but also plenty of ripe pear flavors and touches of spice and acacia blossom. The texture is lush, the flavors bold, just fading a bit in intensity on the finish.",88
Roger Voss,Real Companhia Velha 2007 Porca de Murça Tinto Red (Douro),"A fresh, juicy wine with berry fruits, ripe but intense tannins and a black cherry flavor. There is a delicious, final burst of acidity.",88
Lauren Buzzeo,Recanati 2006 Reserve Kosher Merlot (Ella Valley),"Rich, lush and oaky with aromas and flavors of ripe red plum, red berries and vanilla cream. Round and full in the mouth with solid but soft tannins and moderate acidity. The finish is long and lingering, with suggestions of vanilla ice cream topped with mixed berry compote. Drink now.",88
Paul Gregutt,Bishop Creek Cellars 2007 Whole Cluster Reserve Pinot Noir,"Though the winery indicates that just one quarter of the barrels (all French oak) were new, this wine puts those spicy, toasty scents and flavors of mocha and cinnamon front and center. It's soft and silky, with round, forward flavors of plums dipped in chocolate.",88
Roger Voss,Château Couhins-Lurton 2007  Pessac-Léognan,"A dry, spicy wine, with some good dense tannins. There is some power here, the dark fruits hinting at sweetness, but this is followed by the high acidity typical of the vintage. It should all come together in a year to 18 months.",88
Roger Voss,Château Fonréaud 2007  Listrac-Médoc,"There is plenty of wood, both in aromas and to taste. What is worrying is the dominance of the wood over the relatively light fruit character. There are just hints of Cabernet black currants, but then the wood closes in. It needs 3–4 years to come together.",88
Roger Voss,Château Lieujean 2007  Haut-Médoc,"Good density here, with tannins that spring from bright berry fruits. The acidity is certainly present, but it has weight behind it, giving potential richness balanced by wood.",88
Roger Voss,Château Lynch-Moussas 2007  Pauillac,"A finely made wine, with elegant fruit and tannins, but definitely on the light side. The red berry fruits are soft and juicy, already a pleasure to drink, with only short-term aging.",88
Roger Voss,Château Vray Croix de Gay 2007  Pomerol,"Relatively lightweight, the wine has soft, stalky tannins and flavors of hedgerow fruits to go with the well-judged layer of smoky wood. It is dry, firm and fresh.",88
Roger Voss,Churchill's 2007 Churchill Estates Touriga Nacional (Douro),"A firm, solidly tannic wine that is balanced easily between tight fruit tannins, elegant plum fruits and taut acidity. The aftertaste is smoky from the wood, but with the fruit always present.",88
Roger Voss,Jean Albrecht 2010 Pinot Gris (Alsace),"With light spiciness, this is a full-bodied wine, dominated by tropical fruits. It is rich, rounded, soft, with touches of honey.",87
Roger Voss,La Cave des Vignerons de Pfaffenheim 2009 Pinot Blanc (Alsace),"Attractive, soft, white-fruit wine, its pear flavors rounded and gentle. This is a perfect apéritif style, easy with light acidity to cut through the ripe fruit.",87
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Lakewood 2009 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Subtle and crisp in profile, this not-quite-dry Riesling from Lakewood Vineyards is delicate in its soft, slightly underripe peach and apricot tones. Vibrant acidity and a clean, floral spray on the finish make it wonderfully refreshing.",87
Paul Gregutt,Left Coast Cellars 2008 Suzanne's Estate Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"A fragrant start brings raspberries and rose petals, along with traces of Dr. Pepper and cinnamon spice. In the mouth the wine fades a bit, not showing the depth that the aromas seem to promise. Good flavors, just a little light.",87
Roger Voss,Lucien Albrecht 2009 Cuvée Marie Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"Rounded, spicy wine with only light acidity and more of the lychee and mango side. It is ripe and generous, hinting at a dry core of firmness.",87
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Ravines 2008 Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),"Winemaker Morten Hallgren harnesses a traditional Italian grape-drying technique called appassimento to create this richly concentrated but dry Chardonnay. Initial notes of smoke and roasted hazelnut skins fade on the nose and palate to reveal a clean, fresh apple and pear character, speckled with white flowers and a bright lemon-lime acidity.",87
,Monte del Frá 2008 Tenuta Lena di Mezzo  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso),"Barbecue, black olives, Indian spice and mature fruit open the nose of this rich Ripasso made with a traditional blend of Valpolicella red grapes. There's a touch of green curry and forest floor, but the wine ultimately closes on a plush sweet note.",87
Virginie Boone,Naggiar 2009 Estate Sangiovese (Sierra Foothills),"A tannic Sierra Foothills Sangiovese that's plenty earthy, exhibiting swathes of licorice and berry too.",87
,Novaia 2008  Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso,"This Ripasso opens with a solid, direct approach spearheaded by plump aromas of cherry, chocolate and a touch of root beer. In the mouth, it shows medium structure with a clean, polished close.",87
,Parkers Estate 2010 Blue Ash Road Chardonnay (Sonoma County),"Chard fans will exult in this spicy wine. It packs a potent punch of pineapples, apricots, tangerines and honey, and is nicely balanced with crisp acidity.",87
Michael Schachner,Santa Ema 2009 Reserve Barrel Select Carmenère (Cachapoal Valley),"The spectrum of varietal aromas is here: saline, olive, forest floor, tea and red and black fruits. Weighty and round in the mouth, with good feel and full blackberry flavors supported by creamy oak and vanilla. Juicy and red enough on the finish, where a pop of acidity registers.",87
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Sparkling Pointe 2007 Topaz Imperial Sparkling (North Fork of Long Island),"Topaz Imperial is Sparkling Pointe's first nonvintage blend of the three traditional Champagne grape varieties. While intensely aromatic of ripe red berries and plums, it maintains an elegant dryness throughout. Rich on the palate with a soft, delicate mousse, it lingers long on an earthy, mushroom-scented finish.",87
,Vaona 2007 Paverno  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),"There's an earthy note here that recalls button mushroom and horse skin backed by dried fruit and prune. The wine shows a lighter, crisper mouthfeel with a sweet versus sour contrast at the very end.",87
Joe Czerwinski,Dr. Loosen 2009 Ürziger Würzgarten Alte Reben GG Trocken Riesling (Mosel),"Loosen's Grosses Gewächs bottling from old vines is plump, custardy and slightly sweet-tasting, buoyed by ample ripe apple and peach flavors and tinged with hints of lime, fern fronds and crushed stone. It might well have been more impressive served in a different (sweeter) flight; in this context it seemed slightly soft.",87
Michael Schachner,Echeverria 2009 Reserva Syrah (Maipo Valley),"Vacillates between seeming totally fresh and clean and showing herbal, light green notes. There's graham cracker, jammy blackberry and bergamot on the nose, but also a pickled element. Grabby, chunky and jammy in the mouth, with juicy acidity and blue fruit flavors.",87
Roger Voss,Emile Beyer 2009 Tradition Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"A wine that is so perfumed, consummate pleasure to drink. It is soft as well as rich, the spice packed into a rounded structure. Drink now.",87
,Giuseppe Lonardi 2007  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,"There's a touch of pungent apple skin at first, but the bouquet opens up over time with pretty floral tones and shadings of forest fruit and dried raspberry. For an Amarone, this wine is surprisingly bright and crisp on the close.",87
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Heron Hill 2009 Unoaked Ingle Vineyard Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),"While the nose on this unoaked Chardonnay is exuberant with billowing, ripe yellow stonefruit and floral aromas, the palate is quite brisk in style with a lean, steely acidity. Dry and medium bodied, it's an exceptionally elegant Chardonnay.",87
Jim Gordon,Korbel NV Sweet Cuvée Sparkling (California),"This frankly sweet sparkler smells like toasted almonds and pistachios, and tastes rich, round, floral and nutty. It has a good, fine bead, nice balance from the wine's acidity, and feels smooth and broad in texture.",88
Roger Voss,Lété-Vautrain NV Brut Royal Rosé  (Champagne),"A soft and fruity style of rosé from a small Aube producer, this is ripe with red berry fruit and bright with acidity and orange zest tang. Dominated by Chardonnay, its color coming from still Pinot Noir wine, it's ready to drink now.",88
Sean P. Sullivan,Lone Birch 2015 Cabernet Sauvignon (Yakima Valley),"Dark berry, herb and blue-fruit aromas lead to silky fruit flavors. The tannins bring a slightly sticky feel to the finish.",88

Roger Voss,Real Companhia Velha 2010 Evel Branco White (Douro),"An herbal wine, crisp and green with an attractive citrus edge. Some yellow fruits show while it is the acidity and taut mineral character that is dominant.",86
,Riverbench 2009 Estate Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Riverbench's regular estate Pinot Noir, as opposed to their excellent Mesa reserve, has struggled over the years, and this '09 continues that pattern. It's elegantly structured, but somewhat underripe, with an asparagus edge to the raspberries, cherries and sweet oak.",86
,Rock Hollow 2010 Vintner's Selection Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Barbara County),"The label doesn't tell you, but this is from the Firestone family's Curtis Winery vineyards in the Santa Ynez Valley. It's a very nice wine, especially at this price. A little too sweet, its orange, lime, lemongrass and vanilla flavors are balanced by crisp acidity.",86
Paul Gregutt,Thurston Wolfe 2008 Petite Sirah (Horse Heaven Hills),"The Zephyr Ridge vineyard provides the fruit for this brambly Petite Sirah. It was aged for 22 months in American oak, and has that roughshod character, a mix of wild berry, garrigue and clean earth.",86
Michael Schachner,Viu Manent 2010 Secreto Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),"Crusty and dusty smelling, with dark berry, plum and herbal aromas. Feels edgy and rubbery, then tastes like a mix of herbal black plum, dark cherry and oak dust. Finishes fiery, with peppery flavors and leftover oak.",86
,Zina Hyde Cunningham 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),"A little too sweet for comfort, with jammy orange, apricot and lime flavors. Brisk acidity and a savory minerality help restore balance, but the score would be higher if the finish were drier.",86
Roger Voss,Quinta do Cavalinho 2009 Templários Colheita Seleccionada Touriga Nacional (Tejo),"Dark, burly wine, rich with dusty tannins and plump black plum fruits. The texture is soft, Porty in its sweetness, although the acidity retains freshness. With its juicy aftertaste, the wine could age for 1–2 years.",86
Michael Schachner,San Pedro 2009 Castillo de Molina Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Valley),"Opens with grassy, slightly burnt aromas that later yield to hickory smoke and herbal berry fruit. Feels fresh but prickly, with grabby acidity setting up flavors of herbs, olive, woodspice and red berries. Finishes fresh and minty.",86
Michael Schachner,Sembro 2009 Vendimia Seleccionada  (Ribera del Duero),"Scratchy and a little sharp smelling on first impression, with vanilla and milk chocolate aromas in addition to standard red fruit scents. Feels firm, solid and basic, with dark fruit flavors touched up by young, simple oak notes. Standard and dry on the finish.",86
Lauren Buzzeo,Sieur d'Arques 2007 Toques et Clochers Brut Sparkling (Crémant de Limoux),"Delicate notes of wood-grilled apples, walnut skin and lightly toasted brioche take center stage on this sparkler. Balanced and creamy in the mouth, with a nice streak of ruby red grapefruit pith unfolding on the clean finish.",86
Roger Voss,Terra d'Alter 2009 Tinto Red (Alentejano),"A ripe and juicy wine, the wood flavors giving considerable spice character. Acidity and blackberry fruits work into a wine that has an attractive, if rough-at-the-edges, character.",86
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Treleaven 2009 Reserve Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (Cayuga Lake),"Orange blossoms and toasted brioche tempt on the nose of this elegantly oaked Chardonnay. The palate is concentrated with pristine melon and floral flavors, and just a hint of dusty minerality in the backdrop.",86
,Clayhouse 2009 Red Cedar Vineyard Malbec (Paso Robles),"Marked by zingy acidity, this Malbec shows Cabernet-like black currant flavors and strong, rich tannins. Bone dry, it needs a good steak to punch through the astringency.",86
Michael Schachner,Viña Chocalan 2010 Selección Sauvignon Blanc (Maipo Valley),"Smells vegetal, with aromas of canned peas and beans vying for attention with mature tropical fruit. Feels mealy despite decent acidity, while the flavor profile is from the garden, meaning it's mostly about asparagus and green beans.",82
Michael Schachner,François Lurton 2011 Hacienda Araucano Reserva Pinot Noir (Central Valley),"Smells perky, prickly and tart, with sharp plum and raspberry aromas. Feels citrusy and pithy, with a cutting mouthfeel, and snappy flavors of berry and red plum. Tastes rubbery and slightly bitter on the finish.",82
Roger Voss,Casca Wines 2009 Monte Cascas Reserva Branco White (Minho),"A perfumed wine with wood aging flavors over citrus. From the Vinho Verde region, it's a curious hybrid of a wine, neither crisp enough nor rich enough.",82
,Anatomy 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Soft, with a severe cut of acidity slicing through modest blackberry-jam flavors.",82
,Waterstone 2008 Merlot (Napa Valley),"Soft and thin, with rustic berry, tobacco and spice flavors that finish sweet.",82
,Bianchi 2009 Signature Selection Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),Twin unbalanced notes of vegetables and raisins mar this Cabernet. It's very soft and finishes with notes of prunes and milk chocolate.,82
,Willowbrook 2010 Altes Vineyard Syrah (Sonoma County),"This rustic wine is overripe in prunes and raisins, and hot in alcohol. It's also as sweet as a minor Port.",82
,Hesperian 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Soft, with slightly dilute flavors of blackberry and currant, surrounded by oak. Turns vegetal as it opens.",82
Michael Schachner,Montes 2010 Cherub Rosé of Syrah Rosé (Colchagua Valley),"This rating is probably as much a reflection of tasting the wine too late in its evolution as anything else. At this mature state, the wine is heavy and syrupy, with stalky, almost bitter red-fruit flavors. Finishes with matchstick and grassy flavors. Wait for the 2011.",82
,Stickybeak 2010 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Not quite ripe, with a green, vegetal streak cutting through the thin flavors of cherries. It's a soft, simple country wine.",82
Paul Gregutt,3Fools 2009 Del Rio Red Red (Oregon),"This southern Oregon Syrah has red-fruit aromas, with notes of perfume and plastic.",82
Michael Schachner,Amayna 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),"A strange wine that's not very aromatic beyond basic pear fruit and grass. Feels basic and tastes both green and oddly sweet, with a short, oily feeling finish that ends bitter. Tasted twice with similar findings.",82
Michael Schachner,Arauco 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Valley),"Feels flat and syrupy feeling, with sweet, herb flavors that suggest blueberry and baked plum. Finishes herbal.",82
,Castoro Cellars 2010 Zinfusion Reserve Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"A bit unripe, with some vegetal flavors along with the blackberries. There's also a lot of sweet heat from high alcohol.",82
,Chessman 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"This is a rustic, soft Cabernet. It tastes hotter than the official alcohol level, which is 14.5%, giving heat to the blackberry and prune flavors.",82
,YN NV Red (California),"Sugary sweet and medicinal, like cherry cough syrup.",81
Michael Schachner,Cousiño-Macul 2010 Sauvignon Gris (Maipo Valley),"Crisp but bland, with sharp edges and some bitterness on the finish.",81
,Cerro Prieto 2008 Reserve Merlot (Paso Robles),"Overripe and Porty, with raisin, prune and chocolate flavors that finish hot and slightly sweet. The heat simply overwhelmed this Merlot.",81
Michael Schachner,Oveja Negra 2011 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah Rosé (Maule Valley),"Flat aromas of red licorice candy, grass and maderized fruit are none too inviting. Feels chunky for rosé, with sweet, wayward fruit flavors that come with a burnt stalkiness. Finishes bitter.",81
Paul Gregutt,Melrose 2010 Pinot Noir (Umpqua Valley),"Dilute, with simple strawberry flavors and a disjointed finish.",81
Michael Schachner,Arauco 2011 Carmenère (Central Valley),"Funky and odd smelling, with exotic aromas that are unfamiliar and not that inviting. Feels thick and soupy, with black fruit flavors, cumin, candy and some bitterness on the finish.",81
Roger Voss,Viniverde 2011 Estreia Rosé (Vinho Verde),Aromas of strawberry sherbet are followed by sweet candy-shop flavors on the palate. Chill it thoroughly before drinking. Screwcap.,80
Michael Schachner,Cuevas del Sur 2010 Reserve Chardonnay (Maule Valley),"Fluffy, sweet aromas of peach, pear and vanilla are as good as it gets. Tastes of powdered sugar and the most forced oak you can imagine. Not at all surprising that it's resiny on the finish.",80
Roger Voss,Château Pontet-Canet 2011 Barrel Sample  (Pauillac),"96-98. Barrel sample. The fruit is very pure with a great depth of flavor. This wine has weight, and intense flavors of dark plum and sweet fruit. Impressive.",97
Roger Voss,Château Lafite Rothschild 2011 Barrel Sample  (Pauillac),"95-97. Barrel sample. A powerful wine with dark and dry tannins. It has a great depth of fruit flavor, with immense and concentrated weight, and a structure that is for long-term aging.",96
Roger Voss,Château Pape Clément 2011 Barrel Sample  (Pessac-Léognan),"95-97. Barrel sample. Showing new wood spice, this rich and full-bodied wine also has weighty fruit, with creamy and herbaceous qualities.",96
,Lamborghini 2005 Campoleone Red (Umbria),"This 50-50 blend of Sangiovese and Merlot is one of the best red wines produced in Umbria. The Lamborghini family (of automotive fame) delivers a plush, modern—and yes, racy—red with dark concentration and generous tones of ripe cherry, vanilla and sweet spice. It has a chewy, plush feel in the mouth with bright freshness on the close.",93
Roger Voss,Emmerich Knoll 2006 Ried Schütt Smaragd Riesling (Wachau),"A finely constructed wine that is likely to age over many years. With its juicy currant flavors still dominated by minerality and citrus, there is some austerity. It is a complex wine showing great terroir character from the steep vineyard site.",93
Roger Voss,Rudi Pichler 2006 Wösendorfer Kirchweg Smaragd Riesling (Wachau),"This vineyard, the “way to the church,” gives a full, rounded wine with very pure, direct fruit, and a green structure. This is an impressive wine that offers minerality as well as big fruit.",93
,Ojai 2006 Solomon Hills Special Bottling Two Barrels Made Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),"With 15% residual sugar, this dessert wine is decidedly sweet in apricot, pineapple, pear, honey, vanilla fudge and smoky flavors, with a brisk minerality. It maintains a zesty balance, with crisp acidity.",93
Paul Gregutt,Walla Walla Vintners 2005 Sagemoor Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Sagemoor's old Cab vines comprise 79% of the blend. The rest is a mix of Merlot, Cab Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot, melded into a deep and satisfying whole. Beautifully mixed cassis, berry and cherry fruits are dotted with dried herb. There is plenty of caramel and toast in the lingering finish, and this wine combines hedonistic power with depth and character.",93
,Chalk Hill 2006 Estate Bottled Sauvignon Blanc (Chalk Hill),"Near perfect in the way it tastes almost sweet, then pulls back into dryness. The flavors of pineapples, green apples, pears, peaches and honeysuckle are made even more delicious by the judicious application of new oak and sur lie aging.",93
,Ojai 2004 Thompson Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"Here's a big, rich, densely layered Syrah, the kind of wine that Cab or Merlot lovers who are looking for alternatives should discover. It's full-bodied, dry and oaky, yet with its cherry, chocolate, fig and licorice flavors, offers a whole different flavor profile. Brilliiant with pork tenderloin with a fruity sauce or stuffing.",93
Roger Voss,F X Pichler 2006 Dürnsteiner Kellerberg Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),"A first from Pichler, this is a wine that stopped fermenting while still sweet and offers rich layers of honey, lychees and pepper are all here, as well yellow peaches and honeydew.",93
,Forefathers 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"This is sort of a second wine of the respected veteran winemaker, Nick Goldschmidt, who bottles his more expensive brand under his last name. But there's nothing second-rate about the wine. It's classic Alexander Valley, soft and a little herbal, and rich in cherry, red currant, licorice, sweet vanilla oak and peppery spice flavors. Lovely now, and with the integrity to evolve for a decade.",93
Paul Gregutt,Andrew Will 2005 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Red Wine Red (Red Mountain),"A classic Bordeaux blend. Tight and chewy, this fragrant wine adds whiffs of tobacco to its red currant and cherry fruit. It is a beautifully shaped wine, precise and balanced, compact and intriguing. It will reward decanting and should be cellared for a few years to give maximum enjoyment.",92
,Bridlewood 2004 Estate Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),"Bridlewood has crafted a very serious Syrah, from a region of Santa Barbara County that excels at this Rhône variety. The wine is fully dry and full-bodied, with rich, dense tannins, but what's notable is the depth of flavor. The blackberries, currants, licorice, cola, mocha and smoky oak flavors are very rich. Drink now and for a few years.",92
Roger Voss,F X Pichler 2006 Dürnsteiner Kellerberg Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),"Packed with superripe tropical fruits, this is a concentrated, powerful wine, with lychee and smoke flavors. There is intense acidity to counteract all the richness. Finishes sweet and ripe.",92
Michael Schachner,Felipe Rutini 2004 Apartado Red (Mendoza),"Apartado, a high-flying Bordeaux blend of Malbec, Cabernet and Merlot, shows up only occasionally, but when it does it shines. This vintage is stunning; the black cherry and wild berry flavors are lively and honest, while the wine's structure is just where it should be. With a juicy steak or lamb chops, this wine will bowl you over.",92
,Prix 2004 Reserve Melange Red (Napa Valley),"Rich in red currant, cassis, licorice, cola, vanilla cream and smoky oak flavors, with a smoothly tannic texture, this wine seems to be Cabernet-based. It's made solidly along Napa cult Cab lines, a softly voluptuous wine that's delicious now, and should age well for many years. From Hagafen.",92
Paul Gregutt,Soos Creek 2005 Champoux Vineyard Red Wine Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"This 95% Cabernet Sauvignon perfectly captures the vineyard's strengths: lush, ripe, fleshy fruit that shows perfectly ripened flavors of cherry and cassis, bolstered by ripe, chewy tannins. It's substantial but not tiring; the balance of fruit, acid and tannins holds it together through a spicy, lingering finish. It's just a delicious wine, and one that should cellar well also.",92
,Parry Cellars 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),"Shows a fine, polished Napa style in the perfectly ripe blackberry and currant flavors, and in the way the sweet and ultrarefined tannins give the wine such classic structure. New oak adds just the right touch of smoke and vanilla to this ageworthy 100% Cab. Best after 2010.",92
Paul Gregutt,Pepper Bridge 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The blend is classic Bordeaux—85% Cabernet Sauvignon, 7% Merlot, 5% Cabernet Franc and 3% Malbec. It's got grip and a sensuous mix of wild herb, black olive and mountain berry. There is plenty of acid to support it, and winemaker J-F Pellet has been pulling back on the new oak, so that newer releases of Pepper Bridge are more structured and tilting more toward a European sensibility, which is to say, ageworthy.",92
,Smith-Madrone 2006 Chardonnay (Spring Mountain District),"Dry, crisp and minerally, this Chard has intensely pure flavors of ripe white peach, pear, green apple and pineapple that have a stony scour of cold steel. It's the opposite of the modern style of oaky fruit bomb Chards, with an elegant integrity that's food-friendly and ageworthy. Fine now, and should do interesting things for a decade.",92
,Rancho Sisquoc 2007 Flood Family Vineyards Merlot (Santa Barbara County),"Dry and soft, with the taste of cherry, roasted almond, crunchy granola and fig health candy bar. Enjoyable, but simple. Drink now.",84
Paul Gregutt,Righteous 2008 Righteous Tempranillo (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This has so much raw, rough oak flavor when first opened that the fruit is nearly invisible. Tempranillo may well have a real future in the Walla Walla Valley, but first it has to be freed from the woods. Give this plenty of breathing time.",84
,Crossbarn by Paul Hobbs 2009 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"Oaky and strong in jammy fruit, this Chardonnay has potent pineapple, tropical fruit and buttered caramel popcorn flavors. It's also quite acidic. Would benefit from greater control and nuance.",84
Michael Schachner,Espiritu de Chile 2007 Gran Reserva Carmenère (Curicó Valley),"Tomato leaf, herb and spice aromas mix with green-leaning raspberry and marshmallow sweetness on the nose. The palate is gritty and tough, with salty, herbal cherry and brambly flavors. Short and choppy on the finish.",84
Joe Czerwinski,Frenzy 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"Light and herbal, with a modest core of grapefruit flavors. Grassy notes soften on the finish, allowing some chalky notes to come through. Drink up.",84
,Happy Canyon Vineyard 2009 Chukker Red (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),"Made from Cab Franc, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, in that order, this is a very flavorful wine, with rich blackberry, black currant, cocoa and cedar flavors. But it's very sharp in acidity, with a jalapeño pepper burn that limits its appeal.",84
,181 2008 Merlot (Lodi),"Soft and simple, with slightly sweet pie-filling flavors of cherries and mocha. A decent, everyday wine for picnics, barbecue and such.",84
,Phantom Rivers 2007 Paso del Sol Red (Central Coast),"Soft, fruity and simple, with blackberry, cherry and mocha flavors. Basically dry, but tastes as sweet as jam. Syrah, Cabernet and Mourvèdre.",84
Roger Voss,Provence Rosé 2009 Rosé (Côtes de Provence),"A fresh, high-acid wine, with flavors of raspberry and apple. It's crisp, with fruit that is barely ripe. Needs plenty of chilling.",84
,Redtree 2009 Moscato (California),"Honey-sweet in orange and vanilla flavors, this wine has a good backbone of acidity that makes it crisp and clean. Drink it with vanilla desserts or even cheesecake.",84
Michael Schachner,Santa Ema 2008 Selected Terroir Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),"Opens with a mix of toast and dusty, herbal aromas, and with time it turns more saucy than precisely fruity. A bulky wine with a chunky mouthfeel and fleshy flavors of herbal plum. A late wave of tartness and more herbal flavors cements things into place.",84
,Shiloh Road 2008 Chardonnay (North Coast),"A fruity, direct Chardonnay that will appeal to fans for its peach, pear and oak flavors. Not especially complicated, but a fine example of the variety at a good price.",84
,Vinchio-Vaglio Serra 2008 Cantina Tre Serre Barbera (Piedmont),Cantina Tre Serre is a well-priced and informal Barbera with a thin and informal style backed by fruity freshness. There's even a tiny touch of effervescence that adds a perky and peppery sensation to the mouthfeel.,84
Roger Voss,Yvon Mau 2009 Seigneurs de Bergerac Blanc White (Bergerac Sec),"A bright, creamy wine with light acidity and flavors of green fruits, pears and a strong streak of grapefruit.",84
,Longevity 2009 Viognier (Lodi),"Tastes frankly sweet, with sugary flavors of pineapple marmalade, vanilla custard and butterscotch. It's clean in acids and spicy in the finish. If this is your style, enjoy.",84
,Lucky Star 2009 Pinot Noir (California),"The old saying, you get what you pay for, is perfectly illustrated by this simple Pinot Noir. It's not bad, though, and at this price, will perform the useful function of introducing budding Pinotphiles to the variety.",84
Joe Czerwinski,Jacob's Creek 2009 Pinot Grigio (South Eastern Australia),"This seems to be an attempt at an Italianate style, with modest alcohol levels (11%) and the accompanying lack of fruit expression. It's largely neutral, with hints of underripe pear and white pepper that combine with chalky notes on the finish.",84
Lauren Buzzeo,La Vierge 2008 Temptation The Affair Red (Walker Bay),"“The Affair” refers to the relationship between the French and Italian varieties in the blend. Sadly, this isn't the hottest affair, with the strong game, red currant, strawberry hull, milk chocolate and smoky dried salami notes all downplayed by the lean mouth and waxy finish.",84
Michael Schachner,Luis Felipe Edwards 2009 Reserva Chardonnay (Colchagua Valley),"Not disappointing given the price. There's some toast and tropical fruit on the nose, and then pineapple and mango flavors. The acidity runs a bit sharp, but overall this is a reasonable, warm-climate, tropical Chard for the money.",84
Lauren Buzzeo,MAN Vintners 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Western Cape),"Immediate aromas of chalk and peach waft up from the glass, followed by flavors of green lime and asparagus in the round mouth. The finish is a little heavy, but the flavors are nice and it should be a nice companion to summery soups and grilled vegetables.",84
Lauren Buzzeo,Nederburg 2009 Manor House Sauvignon Blanc (Western Cape),"Nice herbal notes unfold in the bouquet with notes of lime rind, underripe peach and soft bell pepper coming through in the mouth. The finish is clean, like fresh-cut grass, and the overall experience enjoyable.",84
Lauren Buzzeo,Robertson Winery 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Robertson),"A soft, approachable Sauvignon Blanc with aromas of yellow florals, ruby red grapefruit and yellow pepper. Riper peach flavors unfold in the mouth supported by solid acidity and a clean finish, Drink now.",84
Joe Czerwinski,Seresin 2009 Momo Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"A bit broad on the palate, this wine offers ample melon and fig flavors but lacks that vibrant zesty character that so often sets Marlborough Sauvignon apart from the pack. Drink now.",84
Virginie Boone,Chasseur 2012 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Firm and substantial on the palate, this is a complex Pinot, the red cherry fruit juicy and inviting and the wine layered in Chinese five-spice. Light in texture and weight the wine still offers a sense of place and gravitas.",91
Roger Voss,Ruinart NV Brut Rosé  (Champagne),"Pale in color, this is dominated by its taut, nervy structure. Crisp red currant and red apple flavors give the fruitiness. A ripe, full-bodied mouthfeel brings out a softer, riper aftertaste.",91
Virginie Boone,Small Vines 2012 Baranoff Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Planted in 2001 above the Laguna de Santa Rosa near Sebastopol, Baranoff Vineyard is tightly spaced to mostly Calera-clone Pinot, providing the wine's bright raspberry and cherry overtones atop a layering of earth and spice. Thickly structured, it finishes with tart cherry.",91
Roger Voss,Kopke NV 20-Years-Old Tawny  (Port),"Kopke has an impressive quantity of old tawnies, some of which will have ended up in this wine. It certainly seems older than its 20 years with strong wood flavors, smoky toast and beautiful mature acidity. It is very ready to drink, a fine mature tawny.",91
Roger Voss,La Chablisienne 2012 Vaillons Premier Cru  (Chablis),"Soft and full-bodied, this offers bright apple and citrus fruits layered with toast from wood aging. Under the broad exterior, the wine is developing more tangy, zesty fruits and a tight texture. It needs to age to bring everything together. Drink from 2017.",91
Roger Voss,Albert Morot 2012 Cent-Vignes Premier Cru  (Beaune),"This is an austere wine, packed with tannins and tight acidity. The red fruits are right at the back behind the firm structure. A mineral character supports the dusty texture and suggests long-term aging. Drink from 2018.",91
Michael Schachner,Alto Moncayo 2010 Veraton Garnacha (Campo de Borja),"Oaky, heavily roasted aromas of hickory, baking spices, coconut and exotic black-fruit scents feed into a chunky but easygoing palate with spicy, barrel-rich flavors of hickory and vanilla as well as baked berry and leather. A ripe, slightly rubbery finish is generous. Drink through 2018.",91
Roger Voss,Bailly-Lapierre 2011 Egarade  (Crémant de Bourgogne),"Already showing some toasty maturity, this blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir is delicate, yeasty and rounded. Coming from northern Burgundy, it has a cool climate feel, textured with orange zest and the crispest acidity. It is ready to drink, although another few years in bottle will improve it even more.",91
Kerin O’Keefe,Ca' dei Zago 2012 Dosaggio Zero  (Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore),"Made from 80-year-old Glera vines that have never been doused with herbicides or pesticides, this boasts an enticing floral fragrance of jasmine and honeysuckle. The elegant, reserved palate has a pristine quality, delivering green apple, lemon zest, nectarine, pastry cream, herb and mineral alongside a fine perlage. It finishes crisp and clean.",91
Kerin O’Keefe,Ca' del Bosco 2009 Vintage Collection Brut Sparkling (Franciacorta),"Fragrant and floral, this blend of 55% Chardonnay, 30% Pinot Nero and 15% Pinot Bianco offers aromas of lemon blossom, white flowers and toasted almond. The palate shows an impressive depth of flavors, including yellow apple, lemon cream pie and peach alongside an elegant mousse. The creamy flavors are brightened by lively acidity.",91
Matt Kettmann,Morgan 2012 Twelve Clones Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"An amazingly vivid nose of cherry, eucalyptus and morning dew on wild fennel promises a stunning wine in this clonal combo from Morgan. The flavors aren't quite so mind-blowing, though, as basic fruit-punch elements meet with touches of peppercorn and nutmeg.",91
Michael Schachner,Pittacum 2010 Aurea Mencía (Bierzo),"This is a full, round, woody bottling, with graphite, leather and mild herbal aromas. The palate feel is concentrated but also tannic and grating. Flavors of bold black fruits, herbs and barrel resin finish tight, with residual raw oak in abundance. Drink through 2018.",91
Roger Voss,Tendil & Lombardi NV Blanc de Noirs Brut Pinot Noir (Champagne),"Blanc de Noirs, white Champagne only from red grapes, produces wines with some weight, as here. It makes for a rich, full-blooded Champagne, packed with red fruits while also cut through with intense acidity. The fruitiness gains shape from a zesty texture.",91
Roger Voss,Veuve Doussot 2006 Memory Brut  (Champagne),"This is an elegant Champagne, with a burgeoning sense of maturity as well as fresh acidity. Flavors of ripe pear are cut with a light touch of lemon while the overall texture is soft and on the sweet side of Brut. It could age a few more years, so drink now and until 2019.",91
Kerin O’Keefe,Villa Erbice 2008 Tremenel  (Amarone della Valpolicella),"Tilled earth, blue flower, leather, blueberry and cured meat aromas jump out of the glass of this concentrated wine. The rich palate delivers black berry, licorice, chocolate, clove and black pepper alongside firm, chewy tannins. Drink 2016–2023.",91
Michael Schachner,Clos de Chacras 2010 Gran Estirpe Red (Mendoza),"This Malbec-led blend is quite oaky, thus maple, molasses and chocolate aromas ride high alongside blackberry and mild floral notes. In the mouth, this is quasi-syrupy and very rich. Flavors of baked black fruits and brown sugar finish sticky, with chunky weight. Drink through 2018.",91
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Dr. H. Thanisch (Erben Thanisch) 2012 Berncasteler Doctor Auslese Riesling (Mosel),"Scents of honey and freshly pressed apples waft from this delicate sweet Riesling. Bright, sunny peach flavor dominates the palate, but is pierced with a startling vein of lemon acidity. Finishes a savory with lingering notes of pollen and spice.",91
Michael Schachner,El Enemigo 2012 Cabernet Franc (Mendoza),"Rubbery, foxy aromas of blueberry, blackberry, cured meats and spice are packed into an ideal whole. This Cab Franc is rich and flush in feel, with good acidity and balance. An herbal, saucy element accents core berry fruit, while the finish is full of coffee, chocolate, grilled meat and jammy berry flavors. Drink through 2020.",91
Virginie Boone,Fog Crest 2012 Estate Bottled Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Warren Dutton planted the first vineyard block of this Russian River Valley producer, the Pinot a combination of Dijon and Pommard clones. In the hands of new winemaker Jerome Chéry, the wine is exotic in spicy cinnamon and cardamom, earthy and herbal with layers of dark cherry.",91
Kerin O’Keefe,Fratelli Berlucchi 2010 Pas Dosé Vintage Sparkling (Franciacorta),"Made without adding the customary sweetening dosage, this elegant blend of Chardonnay, Pinot Bianco and Pinot Nero opens with floral aromas of passion fruit, ripe pear and walnut. The subtle palate delivers citrus, Golden Delicious apple and toasted walnut alongside brisk acidity and a fine mousse.",91
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Fritz Haag 2012 Brauneberger Juffer Trocken GG Riesling (Mosel),"Smoke and crushed mineral notes open this dry, lusciously textured Riesling. It's slightly savory on the palate, with layers of apple and pear struck by zesty lime and lemon acidity. Powerful and structured, it penetrates long and lean on the finish.",91
Paul Gregutt,Evening Land 2012 Seven Springs Vineyard Chardonnay (Eola-Amity Hills),"Already drinking nicely, this offers generously ripened peach, candied lemon and pineapple fruits. The lush flavors are balanced against fresh, natural acidity, with little or no time in new oak apparent.",91
Paul Gregutt,Evening Land 2012 Seven Springs Vineyard Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"Perfectly capturing the AVA's signature mix of herb, leaf, wild berry and white pepper in a compelling nose, this rolls into a full midpalate that is flush with tangy pie-cherry fruit. Some tasters may find it pushes a bit too far toward the herbal flavors. The overall balance is lovely.",91
Michael Schachner,Gancedo 2012 Mencía (Bierzo),"Initial aromas are oaky and a touch raw, but soon they settle on raspberry and plum. This is a chunky, fruit-forward Mencia with dark berry, raspberry, spice, resiny oak and salty flavors. A full, lively finish is muscular but also fresh and bright. It had only eight months in oak; drink now through 2015.",91
Roger Voss,Ramos-Pinto 2009 RPLBV Late Bottled Vintage  (Port),"Beautifully perfumed, this has ripe blackberry flavors and a relatively dry character. The spirit is now well balanced, giving a backbone to the violet aromas and spicy character of this still-young LBV. It is good to drink now for its fruit, but it will improve and show more complex flavors after 2017–2018.",91
Michael Schachner,Septima 2010 Gran Reserva Red (Mendoza),"A mixture of coconut, cedar and marzipan scents along with gritty, briary black-fruit aromas precedes a lively palate with weight, power and balance. Flavors of berry, plum and cassis are bold, oaky and chocolaty, while the finish hits hard with mocha, caramel and vanilla notes offset by bright acidity. Drink through 2018.",91
,Curtis 2011 Heritage Blanc White (Santa Barbara County),"This fun, delicious wine tastes generous in honey, pear, Meyer lemon, orange, nectarine and white flower flavors, which are balanced by zesty acids. The blend is Grenache Blanc, Roussanne and Viognier.",88
,Feudi di San Gregorio 2010 Rubrato Aglianico (Irpinia),"This is nicely balanced and easy in terms of its tannins and overall intensity, with enough structure to pair with game meat or succulent red meat. The bouquet is redolent of spice, black fruit and crushed granite.",88
,Feudi di San Gregorio 2011  Greco di Tufo,"This producer has a magic touch with its white wines, and this fresh Greco di Tufo is no exception. Mineral nuances are enhanced by notes of stone fruit, honey and citrus. A dusty touch of talcum powder appears on the close.",88
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Grafen Neipperg 2007 Neipperger Schlossberg Spätburgunder (Württemberg),"This Pinot Noir stands out in a flight of German reds for its slightly fleshy, concentrated fruit quality.

Anna Lee C. Iijima,Huber 2009 Trocken Pinot Noir (Baden),"A spray of sour cherry acidity and clean, gravelly minerality lend a tonic feel to this crisp, unabashedly cool-climate Pinot Noir. On the palate, delicate black-cherry and plum flavors are bolstered by layers of smoke and caramel that linger on the finish.",88
,Cantine di Marzo 2009 Aglianico (Irpinia),"Don't underestimate this wine. An Aglianico from Irpinia, it opens with pristine notes of black fruit, tobacco and crushed granite. The aromas are measured in intensity, but the wine's natural tannic backbone gives it importance and staying power.",88
Michael Schachner,François Lurton 2009 El Albar Lurton Barricas Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León),"Big and forward on the bouquet, this has loud, fiery black-cherry and berry aromas.

,Zaca Mesa 2010 Estate Grown and Bottled Grenache (Santa Ynez Valley),"A little one-dimensional but still delicious, this has wave after wave of ripe cherry-pie flavor. Smoky, sweet oak brings an alluring vanilla note, and the mouthfeel is soft and silky. Try pairing this with beef tartare.",88
Michael Schachner,Pazo Serantellos 2011 Albariño (Rías Baixas),"Minerally as well as lemony and zesty on the nose, this is nevertheless neither pushy nor intense.

Paul Gregutt,Pondera 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A high-toned whiff of Band-Aid opens into a broadly flavored wine, with notes of black fruits, baking spices and dark threads of charcoal and roasted coffee. Best for drinking over the next 2–3 years.",88
Roger Voss,Royal Oporto 2009 Vintage  (Port),"A ripe wine from the Real Companhia Velha, this shows a rich character, its tannins ripe and generous. It's not a huge wine, but it does show a fine, full-bodied flavor of sweet plum. The final feeling is smooth and opulent.",88
Paul Gregutt,Novelty Hill 2011 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Roussanne (Columbia Valley (WA)),"There is a strong underpinning of mineral in this wine, supporting crisply defined flavors of melon, pineapple and citrus peel. A medium-ripe, medium-weight, supremely well-crafted and balanced Roussanne.",88
Roger Voss,Château Barde Haut 2008  Saint-Émilion,"Ripe, rich and generous, this has tannins that show the basic structure of the wine, with chocolate and licorice flavors highlighting the wood infuence. At the same time, it has a delicious fruitiness.",88
Roger Voss,Château Belgrave 2009 Diane de Belgrave  (Haut-Médoc),"Already deliciously fruity, this is a big, ripe, black-fruit-dominated wine. To balance the black currant flavor, there is a fine sense of structure, which offers a dry edge along with final acidity.",88

Roger Voss,Château Laurou 2015 Tradition Red (Fronton),"This entry-level wine from Laurou is spicy and fruity. With a layer of tannins as well as attractive acidity, it is a wine to be drunk young. The aftertaste with its hint of licorice continues the spicy character that comes from the Négrette grape in the blend.",86
Michael Schachner,Cuna del Sol 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Valley),"Basic plum aromas are woody and limited. This feels medium to full, with crispness and moderate tannins. Dry woody flavors of plum and currant finish with a freshening blast of lifting acidity.",86

Roger Voss,Domaine Sarragousse 2015 Rosé (Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence),"This attractive, family-owned estate has produced a fruity, crisp and light wine. With its orange-zest acidity, citrus fruits and a tight, mineral character, it is a light wine—bone dry with just a touch of pepper at the end.",86
Michael Schachner,Dominio de la Vega NV Brut Nature Sparkling (Cava),"Aromas of citrus and corn chips are a bit ponderous but do the job in advance of a citrusy, drawn-in palate. Briny grapefruit and orange flavors finish solid but salty.",86
Susan Kostrzewa,Estate Biblia Chora 2015 White (Pangeon),"he nose on this Assyrtiko blend is feisty and spicy, followed a combination of tropical fruit, citrus and vanilla spice on the palate. The wine is fuller bodied but brisk on the finish. Appealing overall and a very nice week-day white.",86
Roger Voss,Falua 2014 Tagus Creek Shiraz-Trincadeira Red (Alentejano),"This blend of this wine is popular in Alentejo with Syrah now part of the repertoire. The wine is warm, with a ripe character and a sunny feel. Its structure and acidity keep the wine balanced. Drink now.",86
Kerin O’Keefe,Fattoria dei Barbi 2014  Rosso di Montalcino,"The nose is rather shy but eventually reveals aromas suggesting wet underbrush, wild herb, new leather and a hint of woodland berry.

Michael Schachner,Viña Requingua 2014 Puerto Viejo Estate Bottled Single Vineyard Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Curicó Valley),"Herbal aromas of tomato leaf and earthy plum are a bit green. This feels chunky, with some grab. Herbal plum flavors are like the nose, meaning they lean towards green. Finishing flavors of olive, spice and herbs are common for value-priced Chilean Cabernet.",86
Kerin O’Keefe,Poggio di Sotto 2013  Rosso di Montalcino,"Aromas of weedy underbrush, oak, menthol and a toasted note emerge in the glass. On the lean, one-dimensional palate, suggestions of vanilla and bitter almond accent raw sour cherry.",86

Virginie Boone,Purple Heart Wines 2013 Red (Napa Valley),"Winemaker Ray Coursen is a Vietnam Vet, and this wine is made to honor other veterans of foreign wars.

Cedar, currant and a sweetness of vanilla fan out on the palate.",86

Matt Kettmann,Clayhouse 2014 Red Cedar Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"This is a sweeter and fruity take on the grape, beginning with a nose of fresh and vibrant boysenberry fruit and wet-asphalt minerality. The palate is tasty in a hedonistic way, but very primary, with flavors of fruit punch.",86
Roger Voss,Domaine de Leyre-Loup 2014  Morgon,There is an earthy character to this wine. It gives a dry edge to the black fruits and crisp acidity. The wine has the tannins typical of the appellation although it also has a light herbal touch that is less attractive. Drink now.,86
Lauren Buzzeo,Domaine Delsol 2015  Picpoul de Pinet,"There's a subtlety to the bouquet of this wine, showing dainty scents of yellow apple, just-dried hay and orange peel.

,Kunde 2011 Kinneybrook Merlot (Sonoma County),"A simple Merlot, it's easy to drink, and will be very nice with everyday fare like burgers or tacos. It's dry and tannic, yet rich in cherries and red currants, with a smooth coating of toasty oak.",86
Roger Voss,Domaine Sainte-Marie 2013 Paparazzi Rosé (Côtes de Provence),"As fresh and fruity as possible, this is a lively wine. Coming in a darkened bottle it looks stylish on a table, although its fragrant red fruits make it even better as an apéritif.",86
Michael Schachner,Don Miguel Gascón 2012 Colosal Red (Mendoza),"Savory scents, a whiff of animal and jammy berry aromas set up a large palate with choppy tannins and lots of breadth. This Malbec-lead blend shows roasted, rubbery black-fruit flavors and a fairly smooth but oaky finish.",86
Michael Schachner,Durigutti 2011 HD Reserva Malbec (Mendoza),"Dense aromas of prune and raisin scream “overripe.” In the mouth, this is heavy, saturated and stewy in feel. Flavors of crème de cassis and brandied cherry finish baked and raisiny. Drink now.",86

Sean P. Sullivan,Jones of Washington 2013 Riesling (Ancient Lakes),"Still settling into its skin, this wine shows a light effervescence when first poured that lifts the notes of freshly cut pear, mandarin orange and wild flowers.

,Sojourn 2012 Gap's Crown Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Grown in a celebrated vineyard, this Pinot isn't showing well at this point. It's heavy and soft, and the raspberry-cherry flavors are compromised by a vegetal quality. Decant and drink up.",86

Anna Lee C. Iijima,Bellwether 2012 A&D Vineyard Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Whiffs of smoke lend a savory feel to pressed apple notes on this dry, delicately framed wine. The palate bristles with lemon-lime acidity and finishes long and lean with a hint of wet stones.",86
Joe Czerwinski,Wairau River 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"A rather pungent, slightly sweaty nose presages a wine that offers loads of passion fruit flavor. While it lacks a bit of dimension and complexity, this medium-bodied offering will work fine alongside citrusy ceviches and the like.",86

Joe Czerwinski,Jean-Luc Colombo 2009 Les Ruchets  (Cornas),"Firmly in the style of the vintage, this is dense, full-bodied Cornas, with plenty of fruit. Intense plum, coffee and black olive notes dominate, while the tannins are ripe and plush. Believe it or not, this is actually drinkable now, yet should age easily through at least 2025.",93
Joe Czerwinski,Paul Jaboulet Aîné 2009 Domaine de Saint Pierre  (Cornas),"Sure, it starts out a bit toasty and cedary, but that wood will surely integrate with the potent plummy, meaty fruit given a few years' time. It's full bodied and a bit coarsely textured for the moment, but finishes long and will clearly benefit from cellaring. Drink 2018–2025.",93
Kerin O’Keefe,Villa S. Anna 2009  Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,"This shows floral and underbrush aromas of violet, forest floor and woodland berries. The palate offers ripe black cherry, red currant, Asian spice and toasted notes. It's structured yet elegant, with firm but fine tannins and nice depth. It's ready now, so enjoy soon.",93
,Testarossa 2010 Brosseau Vineyard Chardonnay (Chalone),"This is the most remniscent of Chablis among Testarossa's new Chardonnays. It's a minerally, chalky wine, bone dry and with lots of acidity, which makes it racy and clean. But it also has a solid core of ripe oranges and limes. It's fine to drink now, and could even develop mushroomy bottle complexity over the next six years.",93
,Testarossa 2010 Niclaire Pinot Noir (California),"Awesomely rich in black cherries, plums, licorice, mocha, cola and sweet oak flavors. Made from selected barrels of the winery's various vineyards around the state, its richness is balanced by brisk acidity and a soft scour of tannins. Drink over the next six years.",93
Roger Voss,Louis Sipp 2008 Osterberg Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"Mango aromas drive this rich wine, full of honey as well as spicy fruits. It is not so much weighty as intense, with a sense of warmth. Now mature and ready to drink, it still retains a youthful fruit character.",93
Kerin O’Keefe,San Giusto a Rentennano 2010  Chianti Classico,"This hallmark Chianti Classico boasts a heady perfume of violet, underbrush, peach blossom and clove. The palate delivers bright red fruit, pepper and cinnamon with crushed cherry in the forefront. It's nicely balanced and should develop complexity over the next few years but is already delicious.",93
,Black Coyote 2010 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Massive fruity extract characterizes this Cabernet. With noble tannins and explosive black currant, cassis and dark chocolate flavors, it defines the modern Napa cult style of soft, delicious complexity. Good to go now, but you're better off holding it for 8–12 years.",93
Roger Voss,Domaine des Baumard 2010  Savennières,"This is perfectly balanced dry Chenin. It has just the right amount of richness, aided by a touch of vanilla. The green and white fruits are blended with deceptively soft acidity to give a wine that feels full and ripe in the mouth. Good to drink now, but also worth aging for 3–4 years and more. Screwcap.",93
Roger Voss,Domaine Ehrhart 2010 Brand Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace),"Mango aromas and flavors give a sense of the sweetness of the wine. It is rich and full bodied, with spice and pepper notes just hinting at acidity. Keep the wine for 3–5 years.",93
Joe Czerwinski,Domaine de Fondrèche 2009 Persia Red (Ventoux),"The name is an oblique reference to Shiraz, which forms the basis of this cuvée. It's inky in hue and rather reticent on the nose at first. But swirl it vigorously and be rewarded with layers of cassis, blackberry and black pepper. Full bodied, rich and tannic, its blueberry and cassis fruit lingers on the long, mouthwatering finish. Drink 2015–2025.",93
Kerin O’Keefe,Antico Colle 2010  Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,"Here's a classically crafted selection, with a lovely floral and earthy fragrance. The palate shows dark-plum and black-cherry flavors laced with white pepper, mint and balsamic accents. While it has tame acidity, it's still tightly wound and needs just a few years to soften and develop additional complexity; drink after 2015. Vi Wines, J & J Importers.",93
Roger Voss,Wine & Soul 2010 Quinta da Manoella VV Red (Douro),VV refers to the old vines that are at the heart of this impressive wine. It has great concentration both from the richly structured fruit and tannins. New wood comes through richly on this powerhouse of texture and density. Give the wine at least six years to mature.,93
Kerin O’Keefe,Istine 2010  Chianti Classico,"Floral and black fruit aromas are punctuated by spicy notes on the nose of this wine. The delicious palate delivers juicy black-cherry, white pepper, mint and sage along with big but ripe tannins and edgy acidity. Give it a few more years to fully develop. Drink 2015–2020.",93
Roger Voss,Joseph Fritsch 2010 Schlossberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"An opulent feeling Riesling, full of peach and pineapple flavors. It's ripe, full in the mouth and textured, its richness masking the dryness of the fruit and the acidity. It could age a few more years—give it 2–4.",93
,Retro 2009 Petite Sirah (Napa Valley),"Retro makes one of the best, most consistent Petite Sirahs in California. Even though they used to source their fruit from Howell Mountain and this bottling now is from Pope Valley and Calistoga, it still shows the same qualities of complex interest based on impeccable winemaking. It's an amazing wine, dry, full-bodied and tannic, with a complex range of berries, currants, herbs and white pepper. Truly a Petite Sirah for Cabernet lovers. Drink now–2020.",93
,Sojourn 2011 Ridgetop Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This Pinot Noir is from the far or “true” Sonoma Coast, near Annapolis, north of the new Fort Ross-Seaview appellation. It shows its origin in the brisk acidity and delicacy of mouthfeel, as well as the fantastic range of wild red berry, cola, pine, nettle and white pepper flavors that change from second to second. New oak brings toasty, vanilla complexities and wood tannins. This is a delicious wine now, but will age gracefully for at least eight years.",93
Roger Voss,Fiuza 2011 Ikon Touriga Nacional (Tejo),"Ikon refers to Touriga Nacional's position as Portugal's iconic grape. It is almost black in color, and profoundly dense and dry with wood tannins at this early stage of development. Yet it promises a palate that's rich and smooth with fruit in time. It's intended for long-term aging so drink from 2017.",93
Kerin O’Keefe,Bibbiano 2010  Chianti Classico,"A lovely, wine, with aromas of red cherry, violet and hints of underbrush. The palate delivers succulent wild cherry, cinnamon and natural vanilla flavors with hint of truffle. It has compelling depth but needs time to tame the structured yet elegant tannins. Drink 2016–2025.",93
Roger Voss,Wines & Winemakers 2009 Aguia Moura em Vinhas Velhas Reserva Red (Douro),"This is a smooth, impressively rich wine powered by silky tannins and ripe black fruits. The palate is intensely concentrated with a big, bold structure and a solid feel. It does need some aging, so drink from 2016.",93
Kerin O’Keefe,Castellinuzza e Piuca 2010  Chianti Classico,"This gorgeous Chianti Classico boasts lively cherry, strawberry and violet aromas. The mouthwatering palate shows concentrated wild-cherry flavor layered with mint, white pepper and clove. It has fresh acidity and firm tannins that will develop complexity with more bottle age. A textbook Chianti Classico.",93
Roger Voss,Domaine Schoffit 2009 Rangen de Thann Grand Cru Clos Saint-Théobald Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"Pale gold-colored wine from an exceptional vineyard. The warmth of the volcanic soil gives richness to the fruit while still keeping some feeling of dryness. It has weight, dried spice and pepper. Honeyed fruits show right at the end. Drink from 2014.",93
,Gary Farrell 2011 Hallberg Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Masses of cherries and raspberries in this single-vineyard wine, and also lots of acidity. It cuts across the palate like a squeeze of lime juice, tart and mouthwatering. Oak shows up in this equation as sweet buttered toast. Altogether, it's a complex, elegant, delicious wine that will develop bottle bouquet over the next 10 years.",93
,Ocone 2008 Calidonio Red (Taburno),"Calidonio is a fascinating and deeply layered wine that is remarkable off the bat thanks to its unique personality and compelling aromatic profile. Piedirosso (85%) is fermented in oak with 15% Aglianico to create tones of black fruit, spicy smoked meat, resin and black licorice. It is smooth and very soft on the close.",92
,Palari 2007  Faro,"Vintner Salvatore Geraci is the proud producer of Palari Faro, one of the great red wines to emerge from the Mediterranean rim and the island of Sicily. The elegance and finesse is extraordinary and the wine opens with a complex bouquet that sees petite elements of cassis, licorice, tar and tobacco rolled into one.",92
,Round Pond 2008 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"Quite a good Cabernet, virgorous and dry, with an earthy edge of sweet, dried herbs alongside the blackberries and cedar. More elegant and food-friendly than many of the fruitier, high alcohol, oaky Cabs out there.",92
Joe Czerwinski,S.A. Prüm 2009 Graacher Himmelreich Spätlese Riesling (Mosel),"A lovely effort from proprietor Raimund Prüm, this plump, creamy-textured spätlese displays ample minerality—there's a distinctly slate-driven note—allied to ripe apple, stone fruit and citrus. Sweet but not overwhelmingly so, this would be terrific with slightly sweet or spicy dishes.",92
Paul Gregutt,Archery Summit 2008 Arcus Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Spicy and assertive, this young, cellar-worthy Pinot Noir just hints at the complexity within. Give it plenty of air time and it opens aromatically with allspice, sandalwood, perhaps some cola and pine needle. The tart and tangy berry fruit is still compact and primary, but fully ripe and nicely sculpted into a well-defined wine from start to finish.",92
Roger Voss,Bernard Baudry 2009 Les Grézeaux  (Chinon),"Old vines, at least 60 years old, are the basis for this soft, wood-aged wine. The texture is smooth, with rounded tannins and density. Flavors include licorice, bittersweet chocolate and black cherries.",92
Roger Voss,Charles Joguet 2009 Clos du Chêne Vert  (Chinon),"This is firmly, tannic, the product of oak cask fermentation as well as aging. The tannins promise long aging, while the ripe black jelly fruit character brings out the richness of the vintage.",92
Roger Voss,Château d'Epire 2009 Cuvée Spéciale  (Savennières),"A wine that combines the richness of the vintage with the extreme flinty texture of young, dry Chenin Blanc. Packed with ripe acidity, it is pure, very crisp, yet for aging.",92
,Dark Matter 2006 Zinfandel (Howell Mountain),"Made in a ripe, soft style that's unusual for Howell Mountain, this Zin could almost be Grenache, or even a big Pinot Noir. The cherry pie filling, raspberry cream and Dr. Pepper flavors are wrapped into soft, gentle tannins. It's a luxurious, exotic Zinfandel whose heat from high alcohol adds a spicy element.",92
Michael Schachner,Domus Aurea 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),"Hails from Macul, so it exhibits some normal eucalyptus on the nose along with spice and pointed, slightly piercing berry aromas. The palate is chewy, sweet, modern and ripe, with chunky berry, herb, olive and particularly graphite flavors. Settles on big black fruit and depth. Outstanding Chilean Cabernet with individuality. Best from 2013-2016.",92
,Rusack 2008 Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"A huge wine, explosive in ripe fruit, elaborated with rich oak and wrapped into smooth, sweet tannins. Made from vineyards throughout the county, it dazzles with a complex of blackberry jam, mocha, date, bacon and smoky sandalwood flavors. Really impressive, especially at this price. Drink Now–2015.",92
,Thomas Fogarty 2008 Windy Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"This Pinot Noir needs a few years in the cellar to mellow, although you can decant it now to let it breathe. It's very rich in cherries, raspberries, licorice and sweet, smoky oak, with a soft, silky texture. Shows a real sense of sophistication.",92
,Tudal 2008 Estate Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A distinguished Cabernet whose superb tannins, which are firm and ripe and refined, testify to its Napa origins. So does the blackberry and currant fruit, which finishes in a swirl of sweet, smoky cedar wood. Good as it is, it's way too young. Should be best around 2015 and afterward.",92
,Viader 2008 Estate Limited Edition Red (Napa Valley),"This interesting wine is an unusual blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and other Bordeaux varieties with nearly half Syrah. It does what Napa does so well, offering a plethora of ripe, delicious cherry, black raspberry, dark chocolate, sweetly smoked oak and peppery spice flavors that are deep and long on the finish. A lovely, accessible wine to drink over the next few years.",92
,Zotovich Cellars 2010 Estate Viognier (Sta. Rita Hills),"A great Viognier, rich and exotic, showing the powerful fruit you want from this variety, in a balanced, elegant way. With a sweet, buttercream mouthfeel, it's brisk in acidity, with powerful flavors of tangerines, pineapples, golden mango and exotic spices, finished with smoky, sweet oak.",92
,Ca' del Bosco 2006 Pinéro Pinot Nero (Sebino),"From 29-year-old Pinot Nero vines, Pinéro is an elegant and fine still red wine produced by one of Italy's most celebrated sparkling wine houses. Polished and finessed down to the smallest detail (those tiny berry aromas come forth so clearly), this wine shows the potential of the Burgundian variety in Italy.",92
Roger Voss,Domaine Huët 2010 Le Haut-Lieu Sec  (Vouvray),Classic. Beautiful acidity is balanced by just a touch of sweetness. The wine is bright with apple and lime flavors.,92
,Donelan 2009 Walker Vine Hill Syrah (Russian River Valley),"Very young, needs plenty of time. Still showing fermentation notes, with brisk, grapey acidity and primary cherry and raspberry fruit flavors. Seems brilliantly constructed and capable of aging, though. Hold until after 2012.",92
,Beckmen 2008 Purisima Mountain Vineyard Grenache (Santa Ynez Valley),"The combination of very high alcohol and what tastes like residual sugar gives this Grenache an excessively sweet, glyceriney taste. It's fabulously rich in raspberry cream, blackberry jam, mocha, vanilla and cinnamon spice flavors. Very flamboyant and delicious, but really more of a dessert wine than a dry table wine.",91
Paul Gregutt,Viento 2009 Underwood Mountain Vineyards 55% Riesling/45% Gewurztraminer Ice Wine Gewürztraminer-Riesling (Columbia Gorge (OR)),"A field blend ice wine—don't see that very often—it's full-bodied, almost lush, and packed with mixed slightly candied fruits—tropical, stone fruits and citrus. Concentrated and poised, it balances on fresh acidity. Just a hint of plastic in the back of the finish.",91
,Villa Matilde 2004 Camarato Red (Falerno del Massico),"Camarato is a beautiful wine and the 2004 vintage shows impressive harmony and elegance. The wine opens with aromas of chocolate, black cherry and spice. In the mouth, it shows firm, enduring tannins. Pair it with a succulent steak.",91
,Wine Spots 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"The upside of the recession is that wines this good are being sold for lower prices, which is great news for consumers. This Cabernet, basically a négociant's blend, is really delicious. It's rich, dry, tannic and lush in blackberry and cherry tart, chocolate and smoky cedar flavors.",91
,Clos Pegase 2009 Mitsuko's Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Carneros),"The best Clos Pegase Sauvignon Blanc in years. Made with a little oak, just enough for creaminess, it's marked by vibrant acidity and complex, lovely flavors of lemongrass, Meyer lemon candy, vanilla, white pepper and the distinct minerality that Carneros white wines often display. Great price for a wine this sophisticated.",91
Roger Voss,Domaine des Baumard 2007 Clos de Saint-Yves  (Savennières),"A finely crafted wine, its tight acidity generating a very fresh profile. There is an intensity of fruit as well as a mineral texture. For aging. Screwcap.",91
Joe Czerwinski,Dr. H. Thanisch (Erben Thanisch) 2009 Berncasteler Doctor Auslese Riesling (Mosel),"The Thanisch wines from the Doctor vineyard rarely stand out in our magazine's blind tastings, making their value proposition questionable. That said, this is a finely elegant wine, with floral details on the nose and enduring stony notes on the finish that mark it as something special. At only 7.5% abv, you'd expect an intensely sweet wine, but the sugars are amply buffered by acids and minerality, so the overall impression is one of richness without excessive weight rather than sugary sweetness.",91
,Elyse 2007 Zinfandel (Howell Mountain),"A real bruiser of a Zinfandel, dark in color, dry and tannic, brimming with massive flavors of wild blackberries, blueberries, dark chocolate and pie spices. The tannins are hard, in the way of this mountain. Drink Now–2013 before it loses fresh fruit.",91
Paul Gregutt,Francis Tannahill 2008 Passito White (Oregon),"A blend of Roussanne, Marsanne and Viognier, this was made in the passito style—grapes were dried to concentrate sugars, then pressed and fermented. The result is a terrific and unusual dessert wine, with candied fruits mixing papaya, guava, banana, Meyer lemon and more. The center is simply lush and fruity; the finish tails off gently with a honeyed kiss.",91
Paul Gregutt,Lachini 2008 Lachini Family Estate Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"Smooth as silk, all estate-grown, this classy Pinot lists five Dijon clones, Pommard, Wadenswil and “Suitcase clone La Tache” on its tech sheet. Vibrant and spicy, with cherries galore (sounds like a James Bond heroine) and a round, full, lush and satisfying mouthfeel. This is the one to drink now, while you cellar the Cuvée Giselle.",91
,Masciarelli 2007 Castello di Semivicoli  (Trebbiano d'Abruzzo),"Named for a beautifully restored castle and boutique hotel in Abruzzo, this beautiful Italian white (made with Trebbiano grapes) shows a delicious creamy texture with abundant aromas of stone fruit, honey and toasted almond. The wine is thick and textured on the close.",91
,Castle Rock 2008 Reserve Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A nice, everyday Pinot, with a properly silky texture. The cherry, cola, red licorice and bacon flavors are satisfyingly rich, with elaborate oak overtones. It's a pretty good value in an under-$20 Pinot Noir.",86
Roger Voss,Château Moncontour NV Brut Chenin Blanc-Chardonnay (Crémant de Loire),"Somewhat hard-edged wine, showing the sharpness of young Chenin Blanc. It has a future, though, as this edge drops away, because there is some good weight as well as bright fresh final acidity. Keep for several months.",86
,Derbes 2006 Chardonnay (Carneros),"Very rich, ripe and oaky, but something of a fruit-oak bomb. Blasts the palate with pineapple jam, toasty meringue, caramel and buttered toast aromas and flavors. Lacks subtlety.",86
,Frog's Leap 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Rutherford),"With no oak, this wine's inherent fruit stars, showing citrus, melons and peaches. With crisp acidity, it's clean, brisk and entirely dry, despite relatively low alcohol. But it's strong in those perfumed pyrazines that turn some people off.",86
,Hellbent 2008 Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon (South Australia),"Juicy and extracted, with bright jam tones and an open-knit structure. There's plenty of berry fruit here and a nice plum tone to the palate that carries over to the fleeting finish. A good choice for a big crowd.",86
Paul Gregutt,Washington Hills 2008 Riesling (Washington),"At 2.3% residual sugar, this is nicely balanced between sweet and dry. The fruit links peach, apricot and pear with a honey in tea streak that carries into the finish.",86
Roger Voss,Ramos-Pinto NV White Reserva  (Port),"Great nutty aromas come from the glass and follow into the palate of this sweeter style of white Port. It is rich, packed with almonds and a tangy orange zest edge.",86
,Sesti 2008  Rosso di Montalcino,"Here's a light and refreshing Rosso di Montalcino with sharp notes of berry, cherry, wet earth and violets. You'll also get some distant mineral tones that add dimension and personality. Pair this easy-drinking wine with your favorite home-cooked pasta dishes.",86
Paul Gregutt,Tagaris 2007 Frank Chiullino Chef Blend Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This red wine, named for the chef at the winery restaurant, is fruity and high-toned, with lots of cherry and berry flavor. All neutral oak, soft tannins, ready to drink.",86
Michael Schachner,Las Colinas Del Ebro 2008 Syrah-Grenache (Terra Alta),"Aromas of fresh tomato, citrus peel and red fruits are a touch austere, but the mouth and flavors are more generous. The palate is well balanced and the flavors run sweet, ripe and chewy, with berry fruit and creamy licorice notes on the finish. A blend of 60% Syrah and 40% Garnacha from Catalonia.",86
,Marquee 2008 Classic Chardonnay (Victoria),"A solid value, the Marquee Victoria Chardonnay has an appealing restraint, hitting pretty high notes on the nose but turning serious and weighty in the mouth. The cream and papaya flavors reach a nice intensity before fading to a mouthwatering finish of guava and pine nuts. Drink now.",86
Michael Schachner,Anciano 2003 Reserva Tempranillo (Valdepeñas),"Definitely an herbal wine, with tomato, oregano, pizza sauce and savory aromas. The palate has good snap and verve to it, while the feel is on the lean side. Flavors of baked berry, earth, caramel and coffee ring true, and the dry, toffee-tinged finish is a nice ending. Ready to go now.",86
Paul Gregutt,Avery Lane 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Washington),"As with the Avery Lane Merlot, this is a rather complex blend, here including Syrah, Cab Franc and Lemberger. Fruity and spicy, with strawberry and cherry candy flavors. Very pleasing picnic wine.",86
,Beltane Ranch 2009 Estate Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma Valley),"A nice, rich Sauvignon Blanc for drinking now with lots of different kinds of foods. With some new oak, it has fruity-sweet flavors of limes, Meyer lemons, apricots and lemongrass, with a tang of gooseberry.",86
Michael Schachner,Bodegas Docampo 2008 Viña do Campo White (Ribeiro),"Tight and largely neutral white fruit aromas show a little apple but little more. The palate is friendly and easy, with melon as the lead flavor. Turns more citrusy and weighty on the finish, which fades fast.",86
Roger Voss,Cortes de Cima 2009 Chaminé Red (Alentejano),"A fresh-faced wine, bright with berry fruits, a light layer of tannins and a soft, easy texture. There is some stalkiness but this is great as a delicious, easy wine.",86
,Crane Brothers 2006 Crane Ranch Vineyard Syrah (Napa Valley),"Rich in berry, cherry, cola, pepper and sandalwood flavors, but a bit off in texture. Feels jagged and angular, with some green tannins. Ready now.",86
,De Loach 2008 Cool Coastal Vineyards Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Very oaky and very ripe, offering a flood of pineapple jam, pear, vanilla and toasty oak flavors. Crisp acidity provides needed balance and a clean, brisk mouthfeel.",86
Roger Voss,Domaine Henry Pellé 2008 Les Bornés  (Menetou-Salon),"Showing pure tropical fruits with a squeeze of lemon, this is a ripe, tasty wine, maybe a little short on acidity, but bringing out ripe lychee and mango flavors.",86
Michael Schachner,El Burro 2008 Kickass Garnacha (Cariñena),"Darker and earthier than most basic Garnachas, with aromas of compost, baked earth, crusty black fruits and leather. The palate has a nice, ripe, bodied feel, while flavors of blackberry and boysenberry bring just the slightest hint of herbal green. Toasty and solid on the finish.",86
,Enkidu 2006 Fazekas Petite Sirah (Napa Valley),"Showing the hard tannins and dryness of a young Petite Sirah, this is the kind of wine you normally would cellar. But there's a little streak of green unripeness that suggests aging will lead nowhere. So drink it now with big, lusty fare.",86
Michael Schachner,Valle de Salinas 2008 Roble Red (Yecla),"Opens with common berry fruit aromas as well as a medicinal, minty note. The palate has short length and definition along with bouncy medium-depth berry flavors. Warm, simple touches of licorice and mint define the finish. A blend of 60% Monastrell with 20% each Syrah and Tempranillo.",86
,Villa San Juliette 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Paso Robles),"A very nice, likeable and super-drinkable Sauvignon Blanc, at an everyday price. Nicely crisp and just slightly sweet, it shows fruity flavors of citrus and tropical fruits, pears and melons.",86
Paul Gregutt,Plaisance Ranch 2014 Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (Applegate Valley),"Barrel-fermented in neutral wood, this gives a quick whiff of buttered croissant, then dives into a moderately ripe palate with lime, pineapple and lemon rind. It's an all-purpose and appealing wine that is drinking nicely right now.",87
Kerin O’Keefe,Poggiobello 2014 Pinot Grigio (Friuli Colli Orientali),"This opens with aromas of hay, pressed yellow flower and orchard fruit. The direct palate offers yellow apple skin, toasted nut and a mineral note alongside invigorating acidity.",87
Virginie Boone,Previous 2013 Chardonnay (Sonoma County),"Closed and youthful, this wine is medium in build and subtle in oak. It conveys a briny streak throughout the palate, and a distinct taste of candied lemon.",87
Kerin O’Keefe,Primosic 2014 Santa Lucia Pinot Grigio (Collio),"Gold with copper hues, this opens with aromas of wildflower, tangerine zest and a whiff of crushed stone. The vibrant palate offers rennet apple, lime, ginger drop and a hint of mineral alongside mouthwatering acidity.",87
Roger Voss,Quinta da Romeira 2014 Prova Régia Arinto (Lisboa),Arinto is the real local grape of the small city of Bucelas where this quinta is located. This fresh wine shows its light mineral and citrus character very well. It also brings out riper fruit flavors that fill it out and give it a rich character. The wine is ready to drink now.,87
Virginie Boone,Roche 2013 Barrel Select American Oak Reserve Chardonnay (Carneros),"Thick, rich and ripe in vanilla, the American oak in this wine is pronounced and intense, wrapping itself around notes of candied apple and toffee-caramel.",87
Kerin O’Keefe,Ronco dei Tassi 2014 Sauvignon (Collio),"Grapefruit, mineral and freshly cut grass aromas lead the way. On the palate, brisk acidity supports pink grapefruit, tangerine and a mineral note.",87
Roger Voss,Sauvion NV Brut Sparkling (Crémant de Loire),"It's the delicious, clean, crisp fruit that's so good about this wine. It is bright with acidity and crisp apple flavors along with a lemon tang texture giving a fine bite. Stylish and fresh, it is a fine apéritif wine in style.",87
Kerin O’Keefe,St. Pauls 2014 Plotzner Pinot Bianco (Alto Adige),"Pear, white flower and crushed rock open on the nose. On the vibrant palate, a mineral note wraps around a core of crisp apple while bracing acidity provides the backbone.",87
Kerin O’Keefe,La Rajade 2014 Friulano (Collio),"Intense aromas of pressed broom, dried herb, hay and a whiff of tomato vine come together in the glass. The palate is fresh but rather closed, eventually revealing yellow apple skin, mineral and a saline note.",87
Kerin O’Keefe,La Tunella 2013 Col Livius Friulano (Friuli Colli Orientali),"Aromas of toasted nut, citrus and oak lead the nose. The linear, rather lean palate shows yellow apple skin, bitter almond and lime zest. A mineral note signals the finish.",87
Kerin O’Keefe,La Vis 2014 Ritratti Pinot Grigio (Trentino),"Fresh and fruity, this lively white offers aromas and flavors of green Anjou pear, Granny Smith apple and white peach. Zesty acidity gives it a crisp, tangy finish.",87
Kerin O’Keefe,La Vis 2014 Vigna Maso Tratta Sauvignon (Trentino),"Delicate varietal aromas of tomato vine, cut grass, citrus and yellow stone fruit come together on this lively wine. The linear palate offers green melon, juicy grapefruit and a hint of tangerine alongside zesty acidity.",87
Paul Gregutt,Le Cadeau 2013 Pinot Noir (Oregon),"Rhubarb and cranberry fruit, along with a touch of red apple suggests minimal ripening. It's a tangy, pleasant wine, light and optimal for near-term drinking with simple poultry dishes.",87
Roger Voss,Louis de Grenelle NV Platine Brut Sparkling (Crémant de Loire),"A fresh, citrus flavored wine with attractive fruitiness and a crisp texture. There is a yeasty edge that should vanish and leave just fruit. Because it is mainly made from Chenin Blanc, there is a nutty, honeyed aftertaste.",87
Kerin O’Keefe,Manincor 2014 Eichorn Pinot Bianco (Alto Adige Terlano),"Aromas of apple, spring flower, bread crust and crushed rock come together in the glass. The brisk palate offers unripe Kaiser pear, citrusy notes and mineral set against a backbone of racy acidity.",87
Virginie Boone,Meadowcroft 2013 Cornerstone Vineyard Pinot Noir (Carneros),"This is a tangy, not entirely varietal wine that's dense in black tea and black fruit, with layers of tobacco and dried herb. Give it time in the glass to open.",87
Matt Kettmann,Mignanelli 2013 Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Pomegranate, dark plum and slate show on the simple nose of this appellation blend. The palate is light, with hints of strawberry and plum as well as pencil lead and mace. It's a great option for chilling a bit and drinking on the beach.",87
Michael Schachner,Monteviejo 2013 Lindaflor Chardonnay (Uco Valley),"This waxy, heavily oaked Chardonnay regularly pulls the same score. This vintage has aromas of grapefruit, quince and garlic. Blasting oak and modest acidity result in flatness, while oak resin is by far the dominant flavor, with creamy apple and pithy bitterness lurking.",87
Kerin O’Keefe,Nals Margreid 2014 Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige),"The nose of this lively white is a combination of delicate aromas of wildflower and orchard fruit while the bright palate offers tart Granny Smith apple, tangerine and a hint of crushed stone. Vibrant acidity carries through to the crisp finish.",87
Michael Schachner,Nisia 2014 Old Vines Verdejo (Rueda),"Apple, peach and melon aromas are clean and fruity. The palate on this Verdejo is melony, which matches the wine's melon and papaya flavors. On the finish, a note of apple cider is detectable. Because of moderate acidity and some flab, it's advisable to drink this now.",87
Matt Kettmann,Passaggio 2014 Lone Oak Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Law enforcement veteran-turned-winemaker Cindy Cosco named this brand for her Italian roots, and presents violet, red cherry and pencil-lead aromas in this bottling. A wild-herb character powers the palate, with bay leaf most prominent, followed by tart elderberries and orange-peel sourness. The grippy palate will open more with age.",87
Paul Gregutt,Plaisance Ranch 2013 Ranch Red (Applegate Valley),"This Bordeaux-style blend is 25% Merlot, the rest an even split between Malbec and Cabernet Franc. Stiff, tannic and earthy, it delivers robust flavors of herb and bark more than ripe fruit. With its assertive tannins, it should stand up well to a grilled tri-tip.",87
Roger Voss,Quinta do Cavalinho 2013 Templários Colheita Seleccionada Red (Tejo),"A juicy, fruity wine that is named after the Knights Templar who built a magnificent castle and convent in the local city of Tomar. It is fresh with red berry acidity and some perfumed tannins. It should be ready to drink soon, but wait until the end of 2016 for the best results.",87
Virginie Boone,Rodney Strong 2013 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Leather saddle wafts from the glass atop ripe cherry, blackberry jam and brown sugar. Tightly wound in tannin and oak, this wine becomes pleasantly juicy on the finish.",87
Kerin O’Keefe,Ronco Blanchis 2014 Ribolla Gialla (Collio),"The nose is a bit shy but reveals delicate scents of citrus and a whiff of peach blossom while the vibrant palate displays crisp apple, tangerine and a hint of steely mineral. Brisk acidity gives it a clean, refreshing finish.",87
Matt Kettmann,Sarah's Vineyard 2011 Old Vine Zinfandel (Santa Clara Valley),"Lavender and lilac are just part of the floral bouquet that emerges from this wine, which also shows a blackberry vinaigrette element on the nose. Once sipped, it's like sucking on a purple-flower candy, with more lavender as well as plum and a pencil-lead edge that cuts through the palate.",87
Kerin O’Keefe,St. Pauls 2014 Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige),"Delicate but alluring scents of spring flower and orchard fruit lift out of the glass. The palate is linear and rather lean but still refreshing, offering pear, yellow apple and mineral alongside bracing acidity. It closes crisp and clean.",87
Kerin O’Keefe,Tenuta di Angoris 2014 Pinot Grigio (Collio),"Fresh and lively, this opens with aromas of jasmine, tropical fruit and a whiff of flint. The vibrant palate offers crunchy Granny Smith and candied lemon alongside brisk acidity. A mineral note energizes the crisp finish.",87
Virginie Boone,Buena Vista 2013 Attila's Selection Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"This is a thick, rich and very ripe wine, with a charred back note making its way against higher-toned tastes of red raspberry and blackberry. The oak is integrated and the wine softly varietal, but it packs a punch on the palate.",87
Michael Schachner,Don Cristobal 1492 2010 1492 Red (Mendoza),"Sharp, prickly aromas suggest tart red plum and wild herbs. The palate is a bit heavy and sticky, with sweet, gummy, medicinal berry flavors. Finishes bitter and peppery, with a medicinal aftertaste.",83
Michael Schachner,Finca El Origen 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),"Tomato leaf, rhubarb and herbal aromas come in front of a tight, tannic and prickly palate with green, spicy berry flavors. Turns hot and smacky on the finish, with carob and herbal flavors.",83
,Glen Ellen 2009 Old Vine Zinfandel (California),"Pretty good for the price, with jammy cherry, berry, cocoa and spice flavors. An easy Zin to drink with BBQ or pasta with tomato sauce.",83
,Manzanita Creek 2005 Carreras Ranch Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"A heavy, sweet Zin. With 16% alcohol, it tastes like a simple Port, with raisin, blackberry and chocolate flavors.",83
Michael Schachner,Montepio 2010 Pinot Gris (San Juan),"Salinic and minerally on the nose, with a hint of peach. The palate is wet and light, however the flavors run stalky and tart, with green banana and bitterness leading to a chalky finish. Quaffable.",83
Michael Schachner,Notro 2010 Tinto Fundación Red (Mendoza),"Red plum, tomato and brambly herbal aromas set up a snappy, astringent palate with strained raspberry, spice and herbal flavors. Very dry and acidic as it transitions to the finish. An herbal, sharp-edged red.",83
Michael Schachner,Ochoa 2010 Rosado Garnacha (Navarra),"Salmon colored, with somewhat flat aromas of peach and sweet melon. Sweet on the palate, with weight and thickness along with cantaloupe and a candied aftertaste. Finishes chunky and flat; tasted twice with inconsistent findings. This note reflects the better bottle.",83
,Robert Mondavi 2010 Pinot Grigio (California),"Overtly sweet, with a white sugar edge to the citrus fruits, this is basically a dessert wine. Earns extra credit for cleanness and crisp acidity.",83
,Starmont 2009 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),It's all about oak in this Chardonnnay. Not much going on beyond the obvious attempt at flattery with buttered toast and vanilla flavors. Maybe a little peach and pineapple candy thrown in for good measure.,83
Roger Voss,Aveleda 2010 Casal Garcia Tinto Red (Portuguese Table Wine),"Light red wine, with a stalky black currant character. It is very fruity, showing herbs and soft tannins. Almost an apéritif red, certainly one for lightly flavored dishes.",83
,Brophy Clark 2009 G-S-M (Santa Ynez Valley),"This blend of Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre is unbalanced. It's sweet in dessert red berry fruit, with an awkward streak of acidity.",83
Michael Schachner,Caligiore 2008 Organic Legacy Old Vines Malbec (Mendoza),"Sweet and syrupy smelling, with maple-covered doughnut and muddled spice and tree bark aromas. The palate is more cutting and acidic than expected, with a sheer mouthfeel and heavy vanilla and oak flavors covering up underdeveloped red fruit notes. Hard, crisp and tannic stuff.",83
Michael Schachner,Caligiore 2010 Pianissimo Rosé (Mendoza),"Heavy and stalky smelling, with burnt aromas. The leaden palate is weighty and short on freshness; tastes pithy and stalky, with some nectarine and plum thrown in. Seems to be fading.",83
Virginie Boone,Cedar Mountain 2007 Hansen Vineyard Reserve Zinfandel (Livermore Valley),"Funky with prune and tobacco overwhelming any fresher fruit, this Livermore Zin is high in alcohol (15.8%), which coats the tongue for a long time after the wine goes down.",83
,Concannon 2010 Selected Vineyards Chardonnay (Central Coast),"Simple and sweet, with jammy pineapple, orange and apricot flavors leading to a soft, honeyed finish.",83
Michael Schachner,Solar de Urbezo 2010 Dance Del Mar Tempranillo-Merlot (Cariñena),"Sweet red plum aromas are candied and jumbled. The wine is clacky in the mouth, with a lot of acidity and narrow, sweet cherry flavors. Shows heat and burn on the finish. 50% Tempranillo-50% Merlot.",83
Roger Voss,Wines & Winemakers 2010 Clemens Reserva White (Vinho Verde),"A soft Vinho Verde, with white fruit flavors, only light acidity and some final sweetness. An attractive apéritif.",83
,Cosentino 2008 The Novelist Meritage (California),"A clumsy wine that aims for white Bordeaux in style and falls far short. There's plenty of oak and lees, but the underlying wine is thin and disappointing in citrus flavor.",83
Joe Czerwinski,De Bortoli 2009 Deen De Bortoli Vat 10 Pinot Noir (South Eastern Australia),"Earthy and tealike, with those attributes framed by charred, nutty oak. It's supple enough to be balanced for immediate consumption.",83
Roger Voss,DFJ Vinhos 2010 Coreto Rosé (Lisboa),"Soft, sweet raspberry fruit-flavored wine. It has a line of acidity while its main character is the light, sweet aftertaste. Screwcap.",83
Joe Czerwinski,Yellow Tail NV Bubbles Sparkling White Wine Sparkling (South Eastern Australia),"Yellow Tail's sparkler is an aromatic blend of Semillon, Traminer, Viognier and Trebbiano that manages to be largely neutral on the palate at the same time it's perfumed on the nose. Frothy and off dry.",83
Roger Voss,Adega Cooperativa Ponte de Barca 2010 Escolha Rosé (Vinho Verde),"On the dry side, with caramel and strawberry flavors, this is an attractive, bright rosé, as fresh as they come.",83
Michael Schachner,Pasaje Alto 2010 Andes Crossing Malbec (Mendoza),"Smells earthy and leathery, with a grilled meat element to the nose. The palate runs sharp and high in acid, with narrow plum flavors. Doesn't offer a whole lot on the finish. More rubbery and tart than ideal.",83
Joe Czerwinski,De Bortoli 2008 DB Family Selection Shiraz (South Eastern Australia),"Herbal and green peppercornish, with dark berry flavors and herbal-vegetal notes. Light and crisp; complex for the price.",83
Michael Schachner,Figaro 2009 Tinto Red (Calatayud),"Starts out with leather and cheesy aromas, and beyond that there's not a lot of fruit on the bouquet. It's a chunky, heavy wine with thick, jammy plum flavors that have strong herbal undertones. Warm, grabby and baked on the finish, which is plodding.",83
,Fattoria di Casalbosco 2006 500ml  (Vin Santo del Chianti),"This is a less formal Vin Santo. The wine is creamy and thick, with sweet syrupy notes of chestnut, honey, maple, candied fruit and dried apricot.",90
Roger Voss,Georges Duboeuf 2009 Clos des Garands  (Fleurie),"Dominated by its dry tannins, this is a tight black currant and dark plum skin-flavored wine, surrounded by a firm core of tannins, a firm and dark-hued wine.",90
Roger Voss,Georges Duboeuf 2009 Sélection  (Moulin-à-Vent),"There is great structure here, with dusty tannins percolating through the rich wine. It has power, concentration and density, with cocoa and cherry flavors well integrated. Think about aging for 1–2 years.",90
,Jarvis 2008 Will Jarvis' Science Project Red (Napa Valley),"This weirdly named wine is a blend of 95% Cabernet Franc and 5% Merlot. It's a bit soft and melted in texture, like liquid licorice, with flavors of cherries, red currants, mocha, anise and smoky oak, and the finish is dry. Notable for the elegance and purity of its tannin structure.",90
Michael Schachner,Kingston Family 2008 Alazan CJ's Barrel Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley),"Big, dark and brash, and very much in the modern California style, meaning it's rich, creamy, oaky and full-bodied. The nose brings toast, heat and potency, while the flavors are saturated, spicy and revolve around wild berry, tea, spice, caramel and savory warmth. Only gets better as it opens and airs; drink now through 2012.",90
Michael Schachner,Lapostolle 2007 Cuvée Alexandre Las Kuras Vineyard Syrah (Cachapoal Valley),"Opens with heavy aromas of raisin, prune, leather and chocolate. The palate is just racy enough, with depth, big tannins and structure. Tastes grapy and big, with blackberry fruit and a chocolaty aftertaste. Toasty and a little gritty and tannic on the finish, and ultimately it's a little sweet but still impressive for Chilean Syrah.",90
Paul Gregutt,Syncline 2009 Subduction White White (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The latest version of this popular blend drops the Chardonnay and adds 11% Grüner Veltliner to the Roussanne-Viognier blend. It seems to elevate the aromatics, pushing lush scents of lemon drop, pineapple, and candied orange peel forward. Those perfectly rendered citrus peel flavors put a frame around the tart fruit, and there is a hint of white pepper in the spicy finish.",90
Michael Schachner,Trapiche 2008 Broquel Bonarda (Mendoza),"Round, thick and pulsing, but not too hard, angular or tannic. The nose brings richness, smoke and black fruits, while the palate is juicy, focused and forward, with black-fruit flavor galore and a slight creamy character. Drying and toasty on the finish, with snappy acidity through the final drop.",90
Roger Voss,Loimer 2009 Reserve Riesling (Kamptal),"Pure, perfumed wine, its floral currant flavored fruit dancing in the glass. There is a bright lift to this delicious fruity wine, just demanding to be drunk. Screw cap.",90
Roger Voss,Louis Latour 2008 Les Beaumonts Premier Cru  (Vosne-Romanée),"A solid, dense wine, packed with tannins and with a dry core. The soft fruit has flavors of strawberry, hinting at richness to come. At this early stage, tannins and acidity are still forming. Hold for five years.",90
Roger Voss,Louis Latour 2008 Les Damodes Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges),"There is a voluptuous edge to this generous wine. It has rich flavors, some strawberry and plum juice. The final extreme freshness shows through the layer of firm tannins. For aging over 4–5 years.",90
,M by Michael Mondavi 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Made from the winery's little vineyard on Atlas Peak, this 100% Cabernet needs time to come around. It doesn't show the voluptuous approachability of the 2005 or the 2007, which will be released next year. It's fairly acidic and tannic. But there's a luscious core of blackberries and black currants. Try after 2012; it might be a very long-lived wine.",90
,Margerum 2007 M5 Red (Santa Barbara County),"A Châteauneuf-du-Pape-style Rhône blend that really nails it for satisfaction. Rich and fruity, spicy, yet with great structure. Defines the vintner's art of blending, comprised of five varieties sourced from a dozen vineyards. Fun and serious at the same time.",90
,Pedroncelli 2007 Family Vineyards Petite Sirah (Dry Creek Valley),"This is a great value in a Petite Sirah that shows how well the variety performs in a great vintage in a warmer climate. With 20% Syrah, which seems to add richness and nobility, the wine is bone dry and elegant in mouthfeel, with complex blackberry, black currant, grilled beef, black pepper and cedar flavors. Drink now.",90
,Pietro Beconcini 1999 Caratello  (Vin Santo del Chianti),"This 60-40 blend of Trebbiano Toscano and Malvasia Bianca offers a traditional interpretation with thick sweetness and aromas of roasted chestnut, caramel and honey.",90
Lauren Buzzeo,Boekenhoutskloof 2007 Syrah (Coastal Region),"This is a robust and firmly structured Syrah with medium-coarse tannins and medium-full weight. Meaty and dark with notes of licorice, black currant, sweet spice and a touch of cocoa on the finish. Though it's intense, it still feels like it's holding back a little bit; try after 2012 for a more forward presentation.",90
,Bortolotti NV Cartizze Dry  (Valdobbiadene Superiore di Cartizze),"The Cartizze cru is known as the best area for growing quality grapes for Prosecco. This precious expression shows drying mineral tones backed by sweet fruit, melon and peach. The soft, creamy quality if the perlage is also noteworthy.",90
Roger Voss,Chanson Père et Fils 2007  Gevrey-Chambertin,"Big, structured and solid, with powerful dense fruit, this is packed with plum juice flavors. The wine feels chunky, while the acidity keeps everything in proportion.",90
Roger Voss,Château Cambon la Pelouse 2008  Haut-Médoc,"With hints of mint, and a firm structure from wood as well as tannins, this is a flattering wine. The tannins are rich, layered within the jammy black berry fruits. This is a wine for aging, but is deceptively attractive now.",90
Roger Voss,Château Lilian Ladouys 2008  Saint-Estèphe,"Since the futures tasting in 2009, the wood element has been tamed. It is still an important factor, but the fruit has blossomed, showing a solid core of tannins, surrounded by dark plum and red fruit flavors. It will need many years, but everything is here now.",90
,Corison 2006 Kronos Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),"You need to give this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon time in the cellar. It's nowhere near ready, even if you're used to tannins in your reds. It's hard as nails in astringency. This 2006 vintage doesn't have quite the concentration of the ‘05, but there are some lovely black cherry and black currant flavors, and they should begin to blossom in 4 or 5 years.",90
,Longboard 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),"Just the kind of Sauvignon Blanc the valley produces so well. It's flavorful in citrus fruits, peaches, golden mangoes and honey, yet balanced with racy acidity. The dry, crisp finish makes it an ideal cocktail sipper.",90
,Margerum 2007 Colson Canyon Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"If more Syrah tasted like this, more people would drink it. Beautifully ripe and soft, pure and rich in cherry and raspberry liqueur, smoke and pepper flavors. Ready now.",90
,Nicolis 2006 500ml  (Recioto della Valpolicella Classico),"Inky dark in appearance and concentration, this muscular Recioto della Valpolicella Classico wraps your tongue tight with its blockbuster power and persistency. Aromas include blackberry jelly, chocolate, cola and exotic spice. It finishes with smooth firmness and loads of personality.",90
,Giacomo Ascheri 2006 Cristina Ascheri  (Gavi di Gavi),"A pleasant wine that shows a sweet, spicy apricot nose; on the palate it has an interesting smokiness that works well with the fruit, and although there is a fair amount of alcohol, the fruit just manages to cover it, and the wine moves to a pleasant if not particularly long finish.",85
Joe Czerwinski,Saint Clair 2007 Vicar's Choice Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"A lightweight Sauvignon Blanc that fits the standard Marlborough profile, with slightly grassy notes layered over grapefruit and pineapple flavors. Drink now.",85
Paul Gregutt,Covey Run 2005 Quail Series Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Light and fruity with pineapple, melon and apple. This fruit forward, food-friendly wine has natural acids and a delicate balance. For the money it is a fine choice to accompany seafood, poultry and pasta salads.",85
,Bearboat 2004 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"A nice wine, good and dry. It has forward peach, pineapple, apricot and oaky vanilla and caramel flavors, and a finely acidic finish.",85
Joe Czerwinski,Spy Valley 2006 Pinot Gris (Marlborough),"Thickly textured and rather sweet, with superripe apples and pears that at times seem almost drenched in honey. Probably best on its own, well-chilled as a hot-weather apéritif.",85
Roger Voss,Jurtschitsch 2006 Schenkenbichl Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),"Big, bold and soft, this is way too heavy. Sure, the Grüner spice is all there, but it is at the expense of a fresh, racy character. The toast character doesn't quite work either.",85
,Valdinera 2005  Barbera d'Alba Superiore,"The Valdinara is a soft, seductive wine showing plenty of jammy fruit, and a pleasant smoky spice. On the finish it is a touch stemmy, but it is so slight that it adds an exotic edge to the wine. Pleasant, not very intense and easy to like.",85
,X 2005 Petite Sirah (Paso Robles),"This is a heavy, bitterly tannic young wine that shows ripe blackberry and coffee flavors and spices. The raw astringency makes it tough now, fit only for greasy foods like barbecued ribs. It should age well for a long time, but will never quite overcome its rustic profile.",85
,Renato Ratti 2004 Villa Pattono Red (Monferrato),"The Ratti proved to be a rich, pleasant, gentle wine, showing lots of plummy fruit, not much acidity and a medium finish. The wine will marry well with a variety of foods, thanks to its hefty texture and its easygoing personality.",85
,Michele Chiarlo 2005 Le Monache Red (Monferrato),"Chiarlo tends to be one of the more reliable producers in Piedmont, and this comes across as a pleasant everyday wine. The fruit is very ripe, bordering on the superripe; but on the palate, the wine has some interesting flavors, dark cherry fruit and hints of licorice and green olive.",85
,Pertinace 2006  Dolcetto d'Alba,"The Pertinace offers a a soft, spicy nose of blackberry jam, vanilla and cinnamon. A pleasant, everyday, food-friendly wine that can be drunk now but has the structure to improve for a year or so. Imported by MW Imports.",85
,Pertinace 2006  Roero Arneis,"The Pertinace evolved nicely in the glass; at first there are simple lime peel aromas, but over time, they become richer and slightly more complex. On the palate there is pear, as well as the lime and an interesting smoky quality. Crisp and with good balance, the finish is a little short. Imported by MW Imports.",85
,Poderi Luigi Einaudi 2004  Dolcetto di Dogliani,"The Einaudi is a fairly hefty version of a Dolcetto, having lost some fruit but gaining an interesting earthy character to the palate. Structurally a little on the chunkier side, but with good concentration. The finish is solid but dominated by the earthiness. Should be drunk soon.",85
Paul Gregutt,Seia 2005 Alder Creek Vineyard Syrah (Horse Heaven Hills),"This is very soft upon entry, with remnants of penetrating spicy and herbal flavors that might have punched up the intensity if they hadn't been somehow smoothed over. It's difficult to assess, because many of the right pieces are all here, but somehow they have not jelled. The wine tastes acidic and sharp, with pineapple and citrus dominating, and a chalky, tannic finish. Perhaps it's just a matter of time?",85
,Kindred 2005 Marsanne-Roussanne-Viognier White (Russian River Valley),"This Rhône blend is soft and sugary sweet, with a honeyed, vanilla fudge and smoky oak edge. The underlying wine flavors are of peaches, pineapples and yellow apricots.",85
,Maddalena 2006 Sauvignon Blanc (Paso Robles),"Like its vintage predecessors, this seems to have some residual sugar, which gives a honeyed sweetness to the peach, pear, fig and honeysuckle flavors. But it has a very crisp, pleasant acidity that keeps the wine lively.",85
,Beringer 2006 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Tangy acidity is the star here. It gives structure and backbone to the lemon, lime, pineapple and fig flavors, and makes the wine a great cocktail sipper.",85
Michael Schachner,Familia Schroeder 2006 Deseado Torrontés (Neuquén),"Sweet and frothy, and made quite close to the Moscato style, meaning the nose is full of flowers and lime. The palate is a mix of crushed children's vitamins, mango and ripe melon.",85
,Il Falchetto 2006 Tenuta Del Fant  (Moscato d'Asti),"Very laid back, the nose shows some mango and pear, but you really have to go looking for them. In contrast, the palate is almost pushy–this is a big, fat intense wine. Essentially quite simple, but very tasty. Short to medium finish.",85
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Red Newt Cellars 2012 Sawmill Creek Vineyards North Block Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Flighty and delicate on the palate, this refreshingly mineral semi-sweet wine is juicy with sweet apple flavor accented with brisk lime acidity. Hints of honey  and white flowers linger softly on the finish.",88
Michael Schachner,Señorío de Caleruega 2009  Ribera del Duero,"Horsey, leathery aromas are earthy and funky, although with time blackberry notes rise up. The wine is lively, tough and offers bracing acidity. Flavors of herbs, licorice and lemony acidity support core blackberry fruit, while the finish is herbal and woodsy, with dark notes of espresso and black licorice.",88
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Silver Thread 2012 Semi-dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Delicate lavender and herb notes perfume this pretty off-dry wine. It's delicate in profile, but flavors of tart yellow stone fruit and blossom gain intensity on the palate with a streak of lemon-lime acidity. It concludes with a refreshing mineral tone.",88
Michael Schachner,Telmo Rodríguez 2012 g Dehesa Gago  (Toro),Minerally black plum and boysenberry aromas set up a rubbery palate with medium weight and intensity. Generic but happy flavors of blackberry and cassis finish with dry spice and rubbery notes  as well as length and freshness.,88
,Breaux 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Virginia),"Precise yellow grapefruit, currant bud and apricot notes lead onto the medium-bodied, zesty palate. The grapefruit note remains dominant on the palate, and the lively acids give it a vibrant edge.",88
Michael Schachner,Chakras 2009 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),"Aromas of brick dust, tobacco, red flowers and cassis come with a touch of herbal green scents. This feels healthy and balanced, with flavors of herbal berry and currant. Things turn a bit saucy and more herbal on the finish.",88
,Chalk Hill 2012 Estate Sauvignon Blanc (Chalk Hill),"Nicely dry and tart in acidity, this pretty wine is fine to drink now. Flavors recall citrus fruits with richer notes of papayas, along with gooseberries and green mint from cool-climate grapes. Made without the malolactic fermentation, the wine was coopered in 55% French oak.",88
Roger Voss,Château Henri Bonnaud 2013 Terre Promise Rosé (Côtes de Provence Sainte-Victoire),"A fruity wine, it shows ripe red berries, red currants and refreshing acidity. So while the wine has weight, it is also totally fresh and crisp. It's a rosé for food, rich while balanced.",88
Roger Voss,Château la Gordonne 2013 Verité du Terroir Rosé (Côtes de Provence),"Very salmon pink in color, this lively, crisp wine has some weight as well as refreshing fruit. It is full-bodied, with citrus and raspberry fruits, dry and very fresh at the end.",88
Kerin O’Keefe,Contrada Michele 2012 Selvecorte  (Fiano di Avellino),"This bright wine reveals fragrances of white flower, pear, citrus and slate. The juicy palate offers grapefruit, lemon-lime and mineral. A succulent finish closes on a note of white almond.",88
Jeff Jenssen,Coronica 2012 Malvasia (Istria),"Salt air, lemon pith and lemon blossom lead in this 100% Malvasia Istriana. A wave of citrus and pronounced juicy grapefruit flavors refreshes the midpalate. The finish is zesty and lively.",88
Paul Gregutt,Covington 2012 Klipsun Vineyard Blanc Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon (Red Mountain),"Roughly half stainless-fermented Sauvignon Blanc and half barrel-fermented Sémillon, this has noticeable sweetness that puts a sugary edge on the flavors. Pineapple and Meyer lemon fruits are round and full-bodied. This should be chilled to cut down some of the sugary flavors.",88
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Dr. Konstantin Frank 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Finger Lakes),"Fresh floral and apple notes are showered with zesty lime and lemon on the nose of this bright, invigorating wine. Dry and medium-bodied in style, the palate boasts hints of freshly cut grass and green apples that lend an herbaceous touch to concentrated grapefruit flavors.",88
Kerin O’Keefe,Fattoria La Rivolta 2012 Greco (Sannio),"A savory wine, it features aromas of lemon zest, stone fruit and hazelnuts. The palate offers lemon-lime, pear and pink grapefruit accented with mineral and an almond note.",88
Michael Schachner,Argento 2012 Bonarda (Mendoza),"Bright, playful berry and plum aromas are clean and fruity. Fresh and juicy, it shows firm but not jagged acidity. Flavors of ripe plum, berry, cocoa powder and herbs finish in forward fashion and not too oaky.",88
Lauren Buzzeo,Beau Joubert 2009 The Ambassador Red (Stellenbosch),"There's a lush, decadent edge to this wine, thanks to heady aromas of vanilla cream, chocolate-covered raspberry and boysenberry preserves. The palate shows more restraint, with textured, fruit-skin flavors of plum and cherry that finish slightly chewy. Enjoy this now.",88
Sean P. Sullivan,Jones of Washington 2013 Viognier (Wahluke Slope),"The aromas are surprisingly light for the variety with notes of ripe pear and peach. It's full bodied with sweet fruit flavors and a rounded, creamy feel leading to a warm finish.",88
Paul Gregutt,Ken Wright 2011 Celilo Chardonnay (Washington),"On the Washington side of the Columbia Gorge, the Celilo Vineyard is an exceptional site for Chardonnay. This was sourced from the 1983 planting, and the relatively old vines and cool vintage deliver a wine with excellent minerality, lift, drive and focus. The fruit is tangy and yellow/green, but perfectly ripe; the acid underpinning is fresh and lively. This has every chance of cellaring until 2024 or later.",88
Joe Czerwinski,Kim Crawford 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"For a wine with such a large volume (over half a million cases were imported to the U.S.), the quality is admirable. Passion fruit and grapefruit elements dominate, while some grassier notes emerge as the wine sits in the glass, resulting in a pleasant blend of tropical and herbal notes. It's plump on the midpalate, then gains focus on the lengthy, mouthwatering finish.",88
Michael Schachner,Llopart 2010 Brut Reserva Rosé Sparkling (Cava),"Dusty, yeasty aromas of red apple skins, cherry and chocolate lead to a solid and true palate with a good bubble bead, moderate elegance and full flavors of plum, red apple, cherry and spice. This is full-bodied Cava with a smooth, robust finish.",88
Joe Czerwinski,Maimai 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Hawke's Bay),"This Hawkes Bay wine seems to be trying to out-Marlborough Marlborough. Scents of crushed tomato leaves are aggressively green, while the acids are crisp, to say the least. That said, it comfortably rides the border between pleasure and pain, ending with notes of razor-like lime juice and soothing, dusty chalk.",88
Kerin O’Keefe,Masseria Felicia 2012 Anthologia Falanghina (Falerno del Massico),"Polished and sleek, this wine opens with tropical fruit and citrus aromas. The steely palate offers grapefruit, lemon zest and nectarine alongside energizing mineral and fresh acidity. It has a clean, refreshing finish.",88
Jeff Jenssen,Miloš 2009 Plavac Mali (Peljesac),"This garnet-colored wine conveys aromas of cranberry, black cherry and bramble. Flavors of dark cherry, cranberry and black plum have a strong acidic backbone and a long finish.",88
,Nickel & Nickel 2012 Stiling Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"From a vineyard in the Green Valley, it has ripe flavors of apricots, tangerines, peaches, pears and Meyer lemons, with lots of smoky, honeyed notes of new French oak. Not very subtle, it will appeal to fans of oaky, ripe Chardonnay.",88
,Niner 2010 Fog Catcher Red (Paso Robles),"The blend is almost equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Cabernet Franc, with some Carmenet and Petit Verdot blended in for complexity. The wine is easy to like now for its dryness and elegance, despite relatively high alcohol. It shows California ripeness of fruit, with a smooth integration of oak. If there's a criticism, it's excessive softness. Drink up.",88
Paul Gregutt,Novelty Hill 2011 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The 10% Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend adds extra muscle to this toasty, sleek wine. It's light but polished, with pretty scents and flavors of rose water and raspberries. The generous acidity of the grape keeps it lively and fresh.",88
Michael Schachner,Pedro Escudero 2013 Fuente Milano Verdejo-Viura (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León),"With minerally, clean aromas of lemon-lime and seashell, this is ready for summer sipping. A tangy, citric palate offers pure orange, tangerine and lime flavors, with mango thrown in for moderate sweetness. A citrusy, cleansing palate is exactly as it should be.",88
Lauren Buzzeo,Raats Family 2012 Original Unwooded Chenin Blanc (Coastal Region),"A crisp, clean and direct selection, this offers great purity and definition. Bright aromas of lime, white melon and apple carry through to the brisk, well-balanced palate, with faint hints of hay and ginger-like spice on the close. Drink now.",88
Lauren Buzzeo,Radford Dale 2012 The Renaissance of Chenin Blanc (Stellenbosch),"Sultry, smoky oak accents the ripe fruit core, full of apricot, peach and pear aromas and flavors. Notes of vanilla custard and orange oil add depth to the medium-weight palate, with brisk acidity that shines on the long, spicy finish. Drink now–2016.",88
Kerin O’Keefe,Sanpaolo 2012  Greco di Tufo,"It begins with aromas of mature tree fruit and spring flowers. The palate delivers a wave of Bartlett pear, peach, yellow apple, nectarine and mineral accented with hints of aromatic herbs and supported by fresh acidity.",88
Sean P. Sullivan,Airfield Estates 2013 Merlot (Yakima Valley),"Raspberry, oak, wood spice, vanilla and herb aromas are followed by plump, jammy red-fruit flavors that provide appeal.",88
Virginie Boone,Ammunition 2014 Pinot Noir (Sonoma County),Sinewy texture and bright acidity meet a funk of blue cheese and forest in this interestingly complex and affordable wine. The earthiness continues in streaks of tart cranberry that ride along the palate.,88
Jim Gordon,Andis 2011 Petite Sirah (Sierra Foothills),"Full bodied, dark and tannic, this is a big wine with aromas and flavors of grilled herbs, black pepper, wood and earth. It feels broad on the palate, has a firm, fine-grained texture and lingering peppery flavors.",88

Mike DeSimone,Wine Man 2014 Mukuzani Saperavi (Kakheti),"Deep ruby in the glass, this wine offers a bouquet of cassis and strawberry.

Joe Czerwinski,Yealands 2014 Single Vineyard Pinot Noir (Awatere Valley),"Yealands is based in the Awatere Valley, a subregion of Marlborough that offers generally cooler, later ripening than the main (Wairau) valley.

Virginie Boone,Matanzas Creek 2013 Helena Bench Sauvignon Blanc (Knights Valley),"Knights Valley continues to be a fine spot for this variety, as evidenced by this wine, which is extremely vibrant in grassy lemon zest and melon.

Matt Kettmann,Kathryn Kennedy 2004 Twenty-Seven Blanc de Blanc Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Just-cracked, yeasty sourdough bread and dried lemon-skin aromas float off of this bottle-aged sparkler from an esteemed, longtime producer.

Michael Schachner,Artesana 2013 Tannat-Merlot-Zinfandel Red (Canelones),"Cherry-berry aromas are floral but also a bit furry and volatile.

Matt Kettmann,Westerly 2014 Chardonnay (Santa Ynez Valley),"For an appellation blend, this is a nicely complex bottling.

Roger Voss,Commanderie de la Bargemone 2014 White (Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence),"This wine is soft and smooth, with just the right amount of acidity to ruffle the surface.

Michael Schachner,Enrique Foster 2009 Edicion Limitada Malbec (Mendoza),"Rugged rustic gritty aromas of roasted plum, saddle leather and baked beans may cause some head scratching.

Sean P. Sullivan,Swiftwater Cellars 2015 Olsen Vineyard Riesling (Yakima Valley),"Bright aromas of peach, lime leaf, jasmine and flowers lead to off-dry mandarin orange and floral flavors. It provides a lot of appeal, though the concentration at times doesn't seem all there.",88
Sean P. Sullivan,Swiftwater Cellars 2015 Proprietary White (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wine is two-thirds Sémillon and one-third Sauvignon Blanc. Aromas of toasted grapenuts, lemon and spice are followed by broad-feeling fruit flavors that show a lightly creamy feel.",88
Joe Czerwinski,Te Mata 2014 Elston Chardonnay (Hawke's Bay),"To my mind, Te Mata's strength s are in its red wines. That said, this is a solid Chardonnay. Subtle wood shadings add richness to the flavors of mandarin orange and vanilla custard before ending on a persistent citrus-oil note.",88
Matt Kettmann,Peloton 2014 Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"This bottling shows fresh blueberry and blackberry aromas as well as a bright purple-flower touch reminiscent of wisteria. Bright and juicy on the palate, it features hedonistic touches of strawberry and olallieberry lifted by clove dust.",88
Virginie Boone,Portalupi 2015 Las Brisas Vineyard Vermentino (Carneros),"This wine is nutty, with a pronounced aroma of stone fruit and preserved lemon. These characteristics follow through on the palate, buoyed by crisp acidity. The finish offers more voluptuous mouthfeel and weight.",88
Virginie Boone,Quivira 2014 Roussanne-Viognier (Dry Creek Valley),"This blend offers a touch of matchstick on the nose, before unleashing vibrantly vervy acidity. Highlights of wet stone, apple, lemon zest and peach show within a medium-bodied context.",88
Roger Voss,Roche de Bellene 2014  Saint-Aubin,"The wine is ripe with a fine mix of generous fruits and layers of toast. It is an opulent wine, full of fruitiness and with a crisper side from juicy acidity. Produced from 48-year-old vines, it has some fine concentration that gives the wine extra richness. Drink from 2017.",88
Virginie Boone,St. Supéry 2013 Dollarhide Estate Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A rich taste of caramel wraps around toasty charred oak in this young estate wine. Dense and chewy, it shows its youth and vintage signature, a sizable presence of tannin.",88
Michael Schachner,Viña Casablanca 2014 Nimbus Single Vineyard Syrah (Casablanca Valley),"Savory berry and tomato aromas come with mild notes of mint and green. This is racy on the palate, with bold acidity. Toasty, savory berry flavors come with chocolaty overtones, while this settles on the palate but remains juicy and high in acidity.",88
Virginie Boone,Judge Palmer 2011 Beckstoffer Georges III Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"From a highly sought-after vineyard site, this wine is intense in tannin and weight, making the fruit work to express itself. Red berry and cherry are given additional richness by a taste of coconut macaroon, with a mellowed finish.",88
Mike DeSimone,Kakhetia Traditional Winemaking 2012 Red Naturally Semi-Sweet Ojaleshi,"Violet-red in color, this semisweet wine has a nose of blackberry and vanilla. It is soft on entry, with flavors of black cherry, blueberry and creme brûlée. It is smooth on the palate, while the blueberry pie finish is brightened up by a brief but not unwelcome tart note.",88
Sean P. Sullivan,Maryhill 2014 Proprietor's Reserve Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Hailing from Tudor Hills Vineyard, the aromas offer notes of padded butter, toast and spice. On the palate, the oak (70% new French) plays prominently, juxtaposed by full-bodied stone-fruit flavors that show some warmth.",88
Jim Gordon,Mirror 2014 Sangiacomo Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),This wine has mild flavors and a full mouthfeel. The aroma is light and vanilla-like while soft pear and nutmeg accents lay low on the palate.,88
Jim Gordon,Monte Volpe 2013 Primo Rosso Red (Mendocino County),"This wine is refreshing, seemingly light in body and texture. Fresh and fruity in flavor, it makes a good house wine to keep in stock.",88
Michael Schachner,Montes 2016 Spring Harvest Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),"Sharp pointy aromas of citrus and green herbs are edgy. This feels minerally and citric, with no excess weight. Flavors of tangerine, lemon and passion fruit are pickled and briny, while this retains a salty slightly green character on the finish.",88
Jim Gordon,Peltier NV USB Red (Lodi),"One of the few red dessert wines with obvious new-oak flavors, this wine smells smoky and toasty. It tastes sweet and black peppery, and is very full bodied.",88
Jim Gordon,Replica 2014 Pickpocket Red (California),"The smoky, spicy aromas and richly oaked flavors of this medium-bodied wine are tempting and delicious. While the wine's personality comes mostly from new oak nuances, good fruit flavors lie underneath.",88
Sean P. Sullivan,Robert Karl 2013 Gunselman Bench Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills),"Hailing from the winery's estate vineyard, this wine offers aromas of baking spice, wood spice, milk chocolate and herb.

Michael Schachner,Senda Verde 2015 Godello (Bierzo),"Nonspecific but pleasant aromas of white fruits, dust and flowers get this Godello off to a good start.

Sean P. Sullivan,Swiftwater Cellars 2013 Malbec (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The aromas of tar, clove, wood spice and dark fruit show nuance. The flavors are velvety and full, pinching together on the finish. The oak seems a bit prominent at times.",88
Matt Kettmann,TAO 2013 Awakening Sangiovese,"This is a promising wine from a Los Angeles County vineyard. Bolstered by 10% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Merlot, it shows dried cherries, coffee syrup, crushed bricks, deep tobacco, leather and sliced-steak notes on the nose. The mouthfeel is full and boisterous with acidity, conveying red cherry and tangy cranberry. An earthy and floral aspect emerges on the finish.",88
Jim Gordon,The Federalist 2014 Honest Red (California),"Full bodied and stuffed with fresh fruit flavors, this dry wine made from grapes from three North Coast California counties smells and tastes like dark grape juice and ripe black cherries. The texture is lively but smooth, and the wine has a light tangy quality to balance its richness.",88
Michael Schachner,Chaman 2014 Cabernet Franc (Mendoza),"Roasted gritty berry and plum aromas suggest moderate ripeness. This feels drawing, tannic and in reverse, meaning it grows harder as it breathes. Dry, lightly salty blackberry and pepper flavors finish spicy, minty and oaky, alongside raw tannins.",88
Kerin O’Keefe,Le Vigne di Ca' Nova 2011 Bric de Maschi  (Barbera d'Alba Superiore),"Aromas of fig, baked plum, vanilla and a whiff of resin emerge on this forward wine. The evolved palate offers raisin, stewed fruit and clove alongside round tannins, but most of the fruit has dried up.",85
Michael Schachner,Lomas del Valle 2014 Coastal Cool Climate Estate Bottled Merlot (Casablanca Valley),"Leafy aromas of olive and herbal berry fruits lead the nose.

Virginie Boone,Barlow 2012 Barrouge Cabernet Sauvignon (Calistoga),"This dry, puckering wine driven by 76% Cabernet Sauvignon also contains 11% Merlot, 10% Petit Verdot and 3% Cabernet Franc. The flavors tend toward the dried cherry, cranberry side of taste, with the oak dense and overpowering.",85
Michael Schachner,Caracol Serrano 2013 Red (Jumilla),"Leather and citrus aromas unleash a mild chemical note on the nose of this Monastrell-Syrah-Cabernet Sauvignon blend. A solid palate with hard, poking tannins leads to cherry flavors that veer towards bitterness. This finishes woody, dry and slightly bitter.",85
Roger Voss,Château de la Bouyère 2013  Bordeaux,"High in acidity, this Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc blend is a crisp, with red-fruit flavors. It is bright and fresh, with light tannins that give structure to the fruits. Drink now.",85
Roger Voss,Château la Croix Saint-Pierre 2013  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux,"This Merlot/Cabernet Sauvignon/Malbec blend is balanced with attractive juicy acidity and red berry flavors, leaving a perfumed aftertaste. As a light wine to drink young, this Carreau family wine is attractive.",85
Virginie Boone,Simi 2014 Dry Rosé (Sonoma County),"Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec and Syrah all play a part in this wine. Pink-red in color and ripely sweet in stone fruit, it conveys intense, full-bodied layers of tannin and texture.",85
Sean P. Sullivan,SuLei 2012 Dona Rae Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A blend of Sangiovese (53%), Cabernet Sauvignon (35%) and Merlot, this wine is aromatically locked up with notes of wet copper penny, cherry and herbs. The flavors are soft in feel with the oak seemingly dialed back. With time, the aromas and flavors may join together better.",85
Virginie Boone,Topanga 2012 Black and White Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"With 20% Merlot and 5% Cabernet Franc, this wine is muted yet robust, speaking with a loud voice of tannin and power. Simple and soft, it's ready to enjoy now.",85

Kerin O’Keefe,Marchesi di Barolo 2014 Ruvei  (Barbera d'Alba),"This simple, informal red opens with delicate aromas of berry, violet and clove. The lively but rather diluted palate offers tart cherry and orange peel alongside racy acidity.",85
Jim Gordon,Mirassou 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"This is tasty, quite ripe and bold in flavor but comfortable in mouthfeel. Soft tannins are apparent and lend some grip to the texture while the acidity is very low and the finish short.",85
Sean P. Sullivan,Hogue 2013 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is a fruit-forward wine, with aromas of red and black currant and herbs with a spice top note. The flavors are sweet and tangy, going down easy.",85

Roger Voss,Les Maîtres Vignerons de la Presqu'île de Saint-Tropez 2014 Easy Rosé (Mediterranée),"This is an attractive, simple and, yes, an easy wine to drink. It has a pretty orange-pink color, crisp citrus fruit and the freshest final acidity.",85
Roger Voss,Les Rocailles 2014 Saint-Jean-de-la-Porte Mondeuse (Vin de Savoie),"This wine is stalky with wild blackberry fruits and spicy acidity. It has a crisp edge, with a fresh character that comes through the herbal tannic flavors. It is all youth and fruit, so will be better from 2016. Chill lightly before drinking.",85
Roger Voss,Les Rocailles NV Caprice Gamay (Vin de France),"Sweet and sparkling, this light, fresh wine is delicious on a hot day or as an apéritif. It is crisp with red berry fruits and a soft, sweet aftertaste that is cut with acidity.",85
Virginie Boone,Vin Roc 2011 RTW Red (Napa Valley),"A red table wine (RTW) combining Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this is stewy, dry and tannic, still puckering from two years spent in French oak. Let it open before settling in.",85
Virginie Boone,Woodenhead 2010 Naturale Single Vineyard Sparkling Colombard (Russian River Valley),"Disgorged in April 2014 four years after harvesting French Colombard from a single vineyard, this méthode champenoise wine is slightly odd in sour lemon and apple, unsure how far to take its acidity. It's a curiosity worth trying, but it won't be for everyone.",85
Roger Voss,Château Siffle Merle 2012 Cuvée Prestige  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux),"Aromas of wood dominate this 100% Merlot aged in oak for 12 months, which also shows on the palate. It is concentrated and firm with acidity although not much fruit yet. Give this wine until 2017. Franck Cot took over the family estate in 1996. The vineyard was certified sustainable in 2011.",85
Virginie Boone,Cosa Obra 2013 Pinot Noir (Sonoma County),"There's a funkiness to this full-bodied wine, from undetermined provenance within the county. Thick in black cherry, it's straightforward and not fussy.",85
Roger Voss,Domaine de Beauregard 2012 Sur Lie  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine),Three years aging have softened the tight acidity of this wine and given it a rounded and creamy character. It still has great freshness and a light touch of apple and crisp grapefruit. Drink this attractive wine now.,85
Michael Schachner,Freixenet NV Cordon Negro Brut Sparkling (Cava),"Lemon-lime aromas are clean but basic. A tangy juice-like palate tastes of briny citrus fruits, while the finish shows standard lime and green-apple flavors.",85
Michael Schachner,Santa Quiteria 2013 BT Bodega Tintoralba Garnacha Tintorera (Almansa),"Dusty strawberry and cherry aromas are modest and fruity. This Garnacha Tintorera is fresh and zesty on the palate, with candied raspberry and red-plum flavors. A mellow, light finish will raise no eyebrows.",85
Michael Schachner,La Purísima 2013 Alphabet Wines Monastrell (Yecla),"Scratchy aromas of red fruits register as raw, with a note of animal hide. This feels racy and wild, but lively. Briny, rugged flavors of raspberry and plum finish tart, with a pickled note that won't let go.",85
Roger Voss,G. H. Mumm NV Cordon Rouge Brut  (Champagne),"Mumm's new generation of Cordon Rouge bottlings is a pleasure. The wine has depth and great full swathes of pear and red apple fruit flavors. It is well integrated, with initial softness tightened up with acidity and yeast flavors.",89
,Guenoc 2007 Chardonnay (Lake County),"Quite a good Chardonnay for the price. Shows classic flavors of pineapples, pears and apples, enriched with smoky oak and vanilla, and folded into a creamy texture. Good value, and easy to find, with 7,800 cases produced.",89
,Valley of the Moon 2006 Cuvée de la Luna Red (Sonoma County),"A blend of all five Bordeaux red varieties, this dry, complex young wine has plenty of elegance. The blackberry, currant, tobacco and cedar flavors have a nice balance of dried herbs. Very nice now.",89
,Pey-Marin 2008 The Shell Mound Riesling (Marin County),"Strikes a welcome note in California white wines with its extreme dryness and crisp, minerally freshness. With tart flavors of citrus, apricot and Asian pear, it's a great restaurant wine.",89
,Saintsbury 2008 Garnet Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Saintsbury's Garnet bottling established the tradition in California of a lighter-style, but no less elegant, Pinot Noir that retails at a decent price. The '08 doesn't disappoint. It's silky and crisp, with ripe flavors of cherries, raspberries, cola and sandalwood. Now–2011.",89
Michael Schachner,Simone 2006 Grand Reserve Red (Maule Valley),"Meaty and leathery on first blush, with chunky dark-fruit aromas leading to a beefy palate with pure plum and blackberry flavors. Thick, layered and relatively deep, with a good DNA and commendable purity and overall quality. Very close to top-level Cab from Chile, with 15% Carmenère and 5% Petit Verdot.",89
,Pieropan 2006 Calvarino  (Soave Classico),"Calvarino is another gorgeous expression of Soave Classico from producer Pieropan, widely considered a quality leader in the area. There are deep layers here of flavor and aromas that include peach, nectarine, almond and thick honey. It has good density and persistency in the mouth.",89
Susan Kostrzewa,Domaine Costa Lazaridi 2008 Château Julia Assyrtiko Assyrtico (Drama),"A snappy nose of citrus and grapefruit is followed by a very pretty balance of fresh apples and citrus and spice. Aromatic but dry, it will pair well with spicy cuisine or grilled seafood.",89
Paul Gregutt,Dunham 2006 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Very pretty and soft upon entry, with tangy boysenberry fruit, this young Syrah is sharply defined and buoyed by sharp acids. Lightly floral and still a bit yeasty, it offers scents of brioche, orange blossom and sweet grape candy. An elegant, feminine Syrah.",89
,Graci 2007  Etna,"Tight and lean, this expression from Mt. Etna boasts delicate aromas of light blueberry, forest fruit, blue flower and smoky ash. There's power and structure here and the wine could stand up to lamb, pork or veal.",89
,Gundlach Bundschu 2008 Estate Vineyard Gewürztraminer (Sonoma Valley),"A beautifully dry Gewürz that shows the variety's exotic, spicy personality, and frames it in a crisp texture of acidity and minerality. Brims with stimulating flavors of lychee, peaches, mangos, apples, honeysuckle flower and just about every spice you can name. Right up there with the best.",89

,Benanti 2006 Rosso di Verzella  (Etna),"Rosso di Verzella is a rich expression from Mt. Etna with luscious aromas of barbecue smoke, bacon, wild berry and slate roof. The wine is elegant and powerful at the same time and offers a fine berry texture in the mouth.",89
Paul Gregutt,Bergevin Lane 2008 Calico White White (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The Calico White is one of the state's most popular white blends, and is moving step by step toward an all-Rhône effort, now 44% Viognier 37% Roussanne, and just 19% Chardonnay. Winemaker Steffan Jorgensen deftly blends vineyards and AVAs to craft a refreshing, lightly-oaked wine with lime, lemon, pale peach and quinine.",89
Roger Voss,Boizel NV Chardonnay Blanc de Blancs Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),"Fine minerality here, with a wine that brings out balanced grapefruit acidity along with some pear juice and green apple skins. The texture is soft, everything well in balance to give a fine apéritif style of wine.",89
Roger Voss,Château Barreyres 2006  Haut-Médoc,"Dense, dark wine, with good black plum, fig, coffee and sweet raisin flavors. The ripe tannins fit well into this fruit mélange, with definite richness from new wood. There is good, juicy power here, as the wine finishes well with both dry tannin and fresh acidity.",89
,Tommasi 2004 Il Sestante Vigneto Monte Masua  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),"This is a thick, masculine Amarone with dense extraction and soda- like qualities of root beer, smoked bacon, A1 Steak Sauce and beef jerky. It delivers enormous power and concentration followed by a thick, meaty feel.",89
,Vigneti Villabella 2003  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,"VillaBella delivers a generous Amarone from the Classico zone with loads of spice and characteristic blackberry and cherry fruit. On the one hand, the wine tastes a bit overripe with strawberry marmalade. On the other, the firm tannins and natural freshness keep it in check. Age this wine another five years.",89
Joe Czerwinski,Wairau River 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"This is a nicely made Marlborough Sauvignon at an attractive price, with herbal, grassy notes and a touch of bell pepper backed by underlying tropical fruit. It's round without being soft, retaining sufficient crispness to serve alone or with seafood.",89
,Le Ragose 2003  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,"Here's an austere Amarone with overripe notes of fruit preserve, blackberry jelly, moist tobacco, leather, spice and root beer. The wine backs dense concentration with amazing intensity of aromas. It's sweet and sour at the same time with firm tannins.",89
,Martin Ranch 2005 Thérèse Vineyards Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Lots of juicy blackberry, cassis and cedar flavors in this dry, full-bodied young wine. But it's also very tannic, with a lockdown astringency. Seems to have the stuffing for more than six years in the cellar.",89
,Newsome-Harlow 2006 Syrah (Calaveras County),"A lovely Syrah. With its touch of spicy bacon, it shows lush flavors of blackberries, black pepper and sandalwood, wrapped into firm but gentle tannins. Easy to drink with garlicky roast lamb.",89
,Guerrieri Rizzardi 2003 Villa Rizzardi  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),"There's a lot of mature fruit and some strawberry jam here backed by prunes, raisins, tobacco, incense and cola. Pretty nuances of white stone and dried hay appear on the nose and the wine ends with sweet, sticky flavors of ripe berry.",89
Michael Schachner,Porta 2007 Gran Reserva Syrah (Aconcagua Valley),"A touch mossy and herbal on the nose, but also poised, balanced and inviting. The palate is juicy and incorporates good mouthfeel, and the flavors of spiced plum have character. Finishes with pepper and toast along with mild tannic bite. Imported by Great Wines Corpora U.S.",89
,Ledgewood Creek 2007 Estate Grown Sauvignon Blanc (Suisun Valley),"A beautiful Sauvignon Blanc that does everything you want with this variety. It's basically dry and crisp in acidity, with polished flavors of lemongrass, pineapple tart, vanilla, buttered toast and steely minerals. Really nice wine at a great price.",89
Roger Voss,Château Nairac 2004  Barsac,"Typically Nairac, this is elegant and delicate, with great freshness and acidity. While it is not hugely concentrated, it is beautifully ripe, an aperitif style rather than for dessert.",89
Michael Schachner,Cosme Palacio y Hermanos 2004 Reserva  (Rioja),"Probably the best wine from this producer that we've rated. It's meaty and rich, with mocha, crusty oak, aged cheese and kirsch aromas. The palate is juicy and balanced, with licorice, blackberry, blueberry and other dark, ripe flavors. Finishes lengthy and toasty, with some refinement. 1,500 cases made.",89
Roger Voss,Domaine Seguin 2007  Pouilly-Fumé,"Great wafts of white currants come from this delicious—but definitely too young—wine. It is full of flavor, fruity and ripe. There's a good structure from green apple skins and tight acidity. Give it another year.",89
,Dr. Konstantin Frank 2007 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"The king of New York State Riesling pulls it off again. This wine opens with a gorgeous blend of mineral and fruit. The vibrant flavors follow through in the mouth with wet stones, apricot, pear and just a touch of slate. The long, elegant finish justifies every penny of the $18 price tag.",89
Roger Voss,Gilberts NV 10-Year-Old Tawny  (Port),"A 10-year-old that tastes older than its indicated age. There is a strong wood-aged feel to it, the toast and vanilla from wood coming through well. It is also on the dry side, giving it spice rather than molasses. The finish is dense, concentrated.",89
Roger Voss,Poças 2001 Late Bottled Vintage  (Port),"An elegant Port, its fruit and firm tannins blending effortlessly with blackberry jelly and spice flavors. It is halfway between a sweet and dry style, the sweetness coming from prunes, the dryness from firm tannins. This could probably age a few years in the bottle.",89
Paul Gregutt,Stoller 2006 SV Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"This wine offers some meaty fruit flavors that gather round the midpalate and hold there; a big bundle of berries, cherries and plums, annotated with cinnamon and spice. There's even a hint of mint, and the slightest suggestion of fresh cilantro; the only off-note is a little gluey flavor in the finish.",89
,Tarapaca 2007 Gran Reserva Carmenère (Maipo Valley),"Toasty and vanilla-scented, with deeper, riper fruit than the Reserva and an extra layer of textural richness. It's plummy, chocolaty and slightly fudge-like in flavor.",89
Michael Schachner,Lustau NV Dry Amontillado Los Arcos Sherry (Jerez),"Lustau calls it dry but Los Arcos definitely has some aromatic and palate sweetness. The nose settles on brown sugar, peach, mixed nuts and honey. It's not super tight or acidic, and thus the palate drips maple and molasses. Medium-bodied and balanced, but with that shot of sugar offset by honest but mellow acids.",89
,Umani Ronchi 2004 Cúmaro Riserva  (Conero),"Here's a Conero Riserva from the estate's San Lorenzo vineyard that holds back nicely in terms of its aromatic intensity and delivers a drinkable, elegant experience instead. The mouthfeel is clean and polished with sweet cherry flavors backed by Asian spice.",89
,W.H. Smith 2007 Umino Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Grown in the Sebastopol Hills area, this Pinot tastes very young and jammy and immature. Released at less than a year of age, it's thick and a little heavy, with cherry, currant and mocha flavors not yet meshed with oak. One wonders why the winery didn't hold it back another year or so. But it could develop in the bottle. Try after 2010.",89
,Watershed 2005 Awakening Cabernet Sauvignon (Margaret River),"Lifted and juicy, this impressive effort from Western Australia shows woodsy, cedary notes on a restrained nose. The palate is drenched in gorgeous cassis and cherry cordial fruit framed by gentle tannins. The crisp finish will cut through steak or pork dishes. Imported by America Uncorked.",89
Roger Voss,Château Rabaud-Promis 2004  Sauternes,"There is such a surprising level of acidity in this wine that it seems unsure of where to go with its sweetness. The fruit flavors are lemon, peach and dry honey. While the wine is likely to age, it is already missing intensity.",88
Paul Gregutt,Chehalem 2007 INOX Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"INOX—from the French inoxidable—is Chehalem's stainless steel-fermented Chardonnay, what some might label “naked” or “unwooded.” It is widely available and very appealing, with a tart, stony texture and bright, acid-driven fruit. Green apple and citrus are front and center in this vintage, with a steely spine of natural acid and virtually no residual sugar.",88
Paul Gregutt,Daedalus Cellars 2006 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Fragrant and soft, this nicely oaked Pinot Noir offers cherry, cola, mocha and toast flavors. If there is a critique to be made, it is that the finish, though clean and pure, feels just a little flat in the mouth, not as lively as the entry promises.",88
Roger Voss,Fournier Père et Fils 2005 Grand Cuvée Fournier Vieilles Vignes  (Sancerre),"A rich wine from a ripe year. The flavors are full and open, edged with a mushroom character that suggests maturity. The fruits are going towards almonds, while the structure has softened.",88
Michael Schachner,Bodegas Dios Baco S.L. NV Oloroso Sherry (Jerez),"Smells and tastes semisweet, with vanilla and molasses on the nose. The palate runs sweet as well, with root beer, brown sugar and brownie flavors. It's enjoyable and made right, but with less acidity and cut than many Sherries. Finishes with a mocha blast and some grabby thickness.",88
,Cantine Barbera 2006 Coda della Foce Red (Menfi),"Coda della Foce (a blend of Nero d'Avola, Merlot and Petit Verdot that sees 17 months in oak) delivers a sweet nose of cherry fruit, red rose, blueberry and Indian spice. The wine has firm density and raw tannins followed by succulent fruit flavors.",88
,Caruso & Minini 2006 Terre di Giumara Sachia Perricone (Sicilia),"Sachia is a pure expression of the Perricone grape variety that shares some similarities to modern Cabernet or Syrah. This is a meaty, full-bodied red with lingering tones of black pepper, sage leaf, smoke and toasted nut lavished over a solid core of cherry fruit. The wine offers thick tannins and firm structure suitable for beef dishes.",88
,Yangarra Estate Vineyard 2007 Single Vineyard Viognier (McLaren Vale),"Vanilla and fresh lumber notes lead the way, but gardenia and stone fruits emerge in the mouth and lead to a long, creamy finish remniscent of a peach milkshake. A final kick of acidity keeps the whole thing balanced.",88
Joe Czerwinski,Yering Station 2006 Reserve Pinot Noir (Yarra Valley),"Usually one of Yarra's top Pinots, the 2006 YS Reserve is a medium-bodied, rounded wine with extremely soft tannic structure. The aromas hint at brown sugar, coffee and cola, with flavors of roasted root vegetables and a touch of mushroom. Supple and silky on the finish. Drink now.",88
Michael Schachner,Alvear NV Amontillado Carlos VII Pedro Ximénez (Montilla-Moriles),"An initial blast of butter and sweaty cheese settles with airing, but this amontillado remains aggressive and demanding up front. In the mouth, this is correct in feel and balance. Saline-rich flavors of walnut, peanut and mushroom finish steady.",90
Virginie Boone,Ampelos 2012 Gamma Syrah (Sta. Rita Hills),"Soft, round and lengthy, there's a lot to admire and enjoy in this wine. Licorice, leather and undulating ripe blackberry and black cherry fruit combine on the palate. It's medium bodied, intense and complex, with dark chocolate accents on the finish.",90
Michael Schachner,Avancia 2014 Mencía (Valdeorras),"Aromas of sweet oak and maple announce that this Mencía received generous barrel treatment. Supple in feel, this tastes of oaky plum and raspberry along with a dash of salt. Jammy berry notes and a hint of Graham cracker rise up on the finish. Drink through 2019.",90
Virginie Boone,Castello di Amorosa 2014 Terra de Promissio Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Crisp and robust in pine-forest aromas, ripe cranberry and savory black tea, this coastal wine is feral yet velvety in texture. Concentrated and full bodied, it has underbelly that's undeniably mineral.",90

Paul Gregutt,Zenith 2015 Auxerrois (Eola-Amity Hills),"Very little Auxerrois is grown in Oregon, and the earliest plantings, the owners note, were here at Zenith. This could be mistaken for a Chardonnay, with ripe melon, peach and banana fruit matched to rounded out flavors of butter and caramel. It was barrel fermented and put through malolactic, much like a fine Chardonnay.",90

Roger Voss,Domaine Jessiaume 2015 Les Gravières Premier Cru  (Santenay),The red wine from this vineyard (which also produces a white) is firm with layers of toast from wood aging as well as the potential for ripe red fruits.

The wine is heavy and dull.",82

,Quarticello NV Ferrando  (Lambrusco dell'Emilia),"Part of the natural wine movement, this frizzy Lambrusco opens with a dark raspberry color and easy aromas of cassis, sour cherry and chopped mint. The foamy close is easy and thin.",82
,Six Degrees 2011 Pinot Noir (California),"A simple Pinot, with Beaujolais-like bubble gum and raspberry-jam flavors. Finishes ripe and a bit sugary.",82
,Austerity 2011 White (California),"Whatever the varieties are on this wine, and it's not disclosed, it's soft, ripe and simple, with orange, peach and lime flavors.",82
Roger Voss,Château de Piote 2012 Red (Bordeaux Clairet),"Bordeaux Claret has a darker color than a rosé, suggesting more weight. This wine, though, also has a green herbal edge that is less attractive.",82
,Costa Archi 2010 Assiolo  (Sangiovese di Romagna Superiore),Assiolo is a slightly tart and bitter expression of Sangiovese with sharp aromas of cherry fruit and plum. The tannins show an astringent and nervous quality.,82
Virginie Boone,Amador Cellars 2006 Westside Vineyard Zinfandel (Amador County),"Earthy and very tight after aging 20 months in barrel and another two years in bottle prior to release, this wine's fruit is slipping away, leaving behind only a pruney sourness.",81
Virginie Boone,Green Truck 2010 Petite Sirah (Mendocino County),"Made from organic grapes, Green Truck's Petite has not a lot going on aromatically and exhibits very little in the way of the variety's profile, tasting like generic red wine.",81
,Brochelle Vineyards 2010 Zinfandel (Paso Robles),"Way too ripe, with the flavors veering into raisins. The alcohol, which is 15.6% abv, really sticks out.",81
Roger Voss,Château Larroque 2012 Red (Bordeaux Rosé),"Intensely acidic wine, its red fruits and caramel hidden behind a tart, over-lemoned flavor. For lovers of mouth-shockingly dry rosé. Screwcap.",81
Michael Schachner,Cornellana 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Cachapoal Valley),"Rubbery, mulchy aromas never clean up and rank as rough. Roughness describes the palate, too, while flavors of herbal fruit, bitterness, hard spices and buttery oak fail to come around.",81
Virginie Boone,Harlow Ridge 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi),"A very basic Cabernet Sauvignon, very low in alcohol, with a harshness on the finish.",81
Virginie Boone,Harlow Ridge 2011 Chardonnay (Lodi),"This bargain-priced wine is oaky and bland, with a smell of menthol.",81
Virginie Boone,Green Truck 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Lake County),"A Lake County SB with very little in the way of aromatics. It's acceptable for everyday, but a generic white wine.",81
Michael Schachner,Dominio de Eguren 2011 Protocolo Rosé (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),"This is no longer in its prime. It tastes weird, mealy and slightly exotic, while the palate feels rubbery. Nectarine and plum notes are detectable on a strained finish.",81
,Vinum 2010 Pinot Noir (California),"Soft, dull and vegetal. Still, it's drinkable for some modest cola flavors and velvety mouthfeel.",81
Michael Schachner,William Cole 2011 Albamar Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley),"This is edgy and lean, with mulch and latex on a stripped back nose. In the mouth, it clangs around due to racy acidity. Flavors of leafy red fruits and citrus are not fully convincing.",81
Michael Schachner,Bodegas 1898 2009 Ramón Roqueta Garnacha (Catalunya),"This reedy, strained Garnacha features cheesy aromas, stalky fruit and chemical notes. The palate is hard in feel, with a weedy, burnt aftertaste.",81
,Fattoria Giuseppe Savini 2011 Rondineto Merlot (Colli Aprutini),"There's a thorny, almost raw quality of fruit here that is backed by a touch of dill weed and black tar. It feels tart and slightly bitter on the close.",80
Michael Schachner,Paul Cheneau NV Demi Sec Sparkling (Cava),"With dusty, candied aromas, the bouquet on this semisweet Cava is scattered all over the map. In the mouth, it's inoffensive, however the wine's candied, melony flavors are cloying and overtly sugary. This is too clumsy and candied to be taken seriously.",80
Michael Schachner,Eguren 2015 Viura (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),"Dry lime and citrus peel aromas are round and solid, nothing more. That more or less describes the palate, which tastes a little bit wheaty and dull, with a note of bitter melon on the finish. Drink now.",85
Roger Voss,Quinta do Castelinho 2013 Quinta Dona Mafalda Vinhas Velhas Red (Douro),This wine offers very ripe fruit that gives an almost-sweet character to what should be a dry wine. There is acidity that helps. Drink now.,85
Paul Gregutt,Rock Point 2014 Pinot Noir (Oregon),"This single vineyard cuvée is quite light, yet retains your interest with a thin dusting of cocoa and ground coffee around the tangy berry fruit. It's a bit earthy, but a pleasant quaffer, along the lines of a generic Bourgogne.",85
Roger Voss,Jose Maria Vieira 2014 Borges Quinta da Soalheira Red (Douro),"This is an easy, fruity wine. Soft and light in character, it has attractive red fruits and acidity. Drink this wine now.",85
Roger Voss,Kopke 2013 Reserva Red (Douro),This soft wine has muted red fruits and light acidity. Drink now.,85
Roger Voss,Les Vignerons Réunis de Monségur 2014 Château Tuilerie Pagès  (Bordeaux),"The wine is rich and ready to drink. With red fruits and warm tannins, it is a ripe wine that has a light structure and balanced acidity. It is already an easy wine—fruity and soft at the end.",85
Matt Kettmann,Martin Ranch 2013 Thérèse Vineyards Dos Niñas Vineyard Syrah (Santa Clara Valley),"The nose on this bottling is classic for the grape: blackberry, dried lilacs, wet asphalt, beef char and black rocks. The palate is more muddled, with flavors of clay and freshly turned earth, without much spice or fruit to note.",85
Paul Gregutt,Weisinger 2013 Estate Tempranillo (Rogue Valley),"The wine was aged in 30% new American oak, and has modest cherry fruit with astringent tannins. There's an underlying earthy flavor, leading into a chalky finish.",85
Jim Gordon,Loft 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (California),This wine smells mildly herbaceous and tastes sufficiently ripe and round to make it attractive to sip.,85
Kerin O’Keefe,Il Feuduccio Di S. Maria D'Orni 2014 Fonte Venna  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo),"Subdued aromas suggesting black plum, game and moist soil come together on this. The thin simple palate offers morello cherry and a hint of brown spice alongside loose, fleeting tannins and zesty acidity.",85
Kerin O’Keefe,Illuminati Dino 2010 Pieluni Riserva  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo Colline Teramane),"Aromas of steeped prune and raspberry jam mix with a note of used leather and chopped herb. The robust but evolved palate offers dried sour cherry, raisin, ground pepper and espresso alongside the heat of evident alcohol. Grainy tannins leave a bracing finish. The fruit has almost dried up completely so drink sooner rather than later.",85
Michael Schachner,Viñalba 2014 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Valle de Uco),"Damp earthy berry aromas are a touch murky. This feels bulky, grabby and tannic, while overriding flavors of coffee, toast and bitter chocolate make fruit a bit player. A choppy finish with hard tannins and herbal berry flavors puts this Cabernet in the midtier category.",85
Michael Schachner,Covila 2015 Adivino Tinto Joven  (Rioja),"Fiery cherry cough-drop aromas are basic at best, crude at worst. Bright and wiry in feel, this tastes of medicinal red fruits.",85
Roger Voss,Adega Mãe 2014 Chardonnay (Lisboa),"With light wood-aging flavors, this creamy wine is still young, with tangy orange and lemon zest as well as touches of vanilla. Let it develop further and drink from late 2017.",85
Roger Voss,Adega Mãe 2014 Viognier (Lisboa),"This is a wood-fermented wine, spicy and lightly perfumed. The wood aging does dominate the yellow fruits and acidity that still need time. Drink this wine from late 2017.",85
Kerin O’Keefe,Barba 2013 I Vasari Old Vines  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo),"Aromas of French oak and coconut lead the nose. Oak carries over to the lean, bracing palate where you'll also detect raw sour cherry. It lacks the fruit richness needed to stand up to the oak while raspy tannins leave an astringent, mouth puckering finish.",85
Paul Gregutt,Beacon Hill 2015 Riesling,"This is dry, almost sour, despite its low alcohol, and feels disjointed. Along with the sour citrus flavor is a conflicting streak of too-ripe fruit. Interesting components, but they may or may not knit together with more bottle age.",85
Roger Voss,Casa Ferreirinha 2015 Esteva Red (Douro),"This wine is ripe, fruity and balanced. It has red-berry flavors along with acidity and a bright aftertaste. Drink from 2019",85
Roger Voss,Casa Santos Lima 2015 Gewurztraminer (Lisboa),"This is a typically perfumed Gewürztraminer with the twist of a cool ocean climate. That coolness allows plenty of acidity to come into this dry, fruity wine and adds a floral character. With its crispness, it is bright as well as aromatic. Drink now.",85
Roger Voss,Château de Birot 2015  Bordeaux Blanc,"The Birot estate is in Cadillac, the fortress town on the banks of the Garonne. This classic Sauvignon and Sémillon blend is herbal, green and grassy. It is bright with acidity and lemon fruit and with a lightly tangy texture. Drink now.",85
Michael Schachner,Chic Barcelona NV Semi-Sec Rosé Sparkling (Cava),"Perfumed aromas are forced and less than natural. This feels about right, with citric acidity maintaining balance. Flavors of candied orange and cantaloupe finish with obvious residual sugar along with modest acidic cut.",85
Roger Voss,DFJ Vinhos 2013 Paxis Pinot Noir (Lisboa),This softly perfumed wine has red-fruit flavors and plenty of acidity. It is jammy and juicy with succulent red berries. Drink now.,85
Roger Voss,Prats & Symington LDA 2015 Prazo de Roriz Red (Douro),"This wine is soft, with gentle tannins and red-berry fruits. It will develop quickly, so drink from 2019.",85
Roger Voss,Quinta do Filoco 2011 Reserva Red (Douro),"Strong tannins dominate this wine. It comes from a good vintage, but it is quite extracted. It could soften, although it may remain a tough wine.",85
Roger Voss,Quinta dos Poços 2014 Grande Reserva Red (Douro),"The tannins dominate this wine, giving a hard-edged character. It is firm but without the fruit weight to support it.",85
Roger Voss,Sanguinhal 2013 Casabel Red (Lisboa),"This soft, wine is full of ripe black-currant flavors. It is smooth and rounded, with a touch of wood and plenty of acidity. Drink now.",85
Paul Gregutt,South Stage 2010 Alchemy Red (Rogue Valley),"This six-year-old wine is 40% Tempranillo, 40% Carmenère and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon. The Carmenère dominates, pushing stiff, tannic, stemmy flavors into the core. It's not in danger of aging too quickly, but the tannins seem unlikely to soften.",85
Kerin O’Keefe,Villa Giada 2015 Suri  (Moscato d'Asti),"This frothy wine offers aromas of cut grass, hay and chopped herb. The aromas carry over to the sweet simple palate along with ripe apricot and a confectionery note.",85
Roger Voss,Manzwine 2015 Rosé (Lisboa),"Made from Castelão grapes, this crisp wine has red fruits that burst out of the glass and give a lively aftertaste, with tight acidity. Drink now.",85
Roger Voss,Messias 2014 Selection Red (Bairrada),"This ripe blend holds 80% Baga, with the rest Merlot. The Merlot softens the firmer tannins of the Baga, giving the wine its red-fruit character with a juicy aftertaste. Drink the wine now.",85
Michael Schachner,Palacio de Fefiñanes 2009 Albariño (Rías Baixas),"One of the most cutting, acid-intense Albariños out there. The nose in minerally and tight as a drum, with green melon and green apple scents. The palate is razor sharp and driving, with tangy, high-toned lemon and Granny Smith apple flavors. Totally citric and zesty; it will last another few years.",87
,Perception 2008 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"This rich, oaky Chardonnay has aromas and flavors of buttered toast, buttered popcorn, vanilla and pineapple jam. It's very rich and creamy, and appeals for sheer deliciouness.",87
,Qupé 2008 Syrah (Central Coast),"Shows the classy elegance of all Qupe's Syrahs, although it's thinner and rougher than the more expensive bottlings. Still, for the price, this wine is nicely dry and intricate in blackberry and crushed pepper flavors.",87
,Ridge 2008 York Creek Zinfandel (California),"A bit thin and acidic, but charming for its dryness and firm tannins, which call for rich, marbled beef. The pepper-inspired blackberry and cassis flavors are fine. Not an ager, but will benefit from a few hours of decanting.",87
,Sanguis 2006 Waxing Poetic Syrah (California),"Made from 100% Syrah and aged in 100% new French oak, this wine is currently hard, astringent and oaky, with caramel, vanilla and buttered toast aromas and flavors. The actual Syrah itself is clean and pure in ripe blackberry jam. Might do something over the years, but probably best now, with a decant.",87
,Santa Sofia 2007  Valpolicella Superiore Ripasso,"Aged in large oak casks, this fresh Ripasso makes good use of minimal wood intervention that comes forth as light spice and cinnamon. The core of this wine, however, consists of pulsing black fruit and mature cherry.",87
,Sartori 2006 Vigneti di Montegradella  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore),"Vigneti di Montegradella is a well-priced Valpolicella with more intensity and density than you'd expect. In fact, the wine offers determination and personality with enough natural extraction to pair with bean soup or barbecued hamburgers.",87
,Scott Family 2008 Pinot Noir (Arroyo Seco),"This is a fresh, lively Pinot Noir for drinking now. It's elegantly silky and dry, with crisp acids and pure flavors of cherries, cola, spices and oak. A touch of oak adds smoky richness.",87
,St. Francis 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),"Good price for a nicely complex Cabernet for drinking now. Dry and smooth in tannins, it shows ripe blackberry, cherry, licorice and herb flavors, with a kiss of oak.",87
,Allegrini 2008 Corte Giara  (Valpolicella Ripasso),"In the past, Allegrini adopted a vocal stand against Ripasso (a middle ground wine between Amarone and Valpolicella) and for this reason Corte Giara Ripasso comes as a big surprise. Despite the controversy, this historic producer presents a very acceptable wine with pretty tones of sweet spice and bright berry.",87
,Arger-Martucci 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A shade off the 2005, being leaner and more tannic, and more akin to the 2001. It's a dry, taut Cab, marked by a drying astringency accompanying the blackberry and mineral flavors. Drink now–2012.",87
,Arrowood 2008 Saralee's Vineyard Viognier (Russian River Valley),"This 100% Viognier shows the variety's exotic side, with delicious tropical fruit, citrus, pear, melon, lychee and smoky oak flavors. It's a bit one-dimensional, but appeals for its fresh acids and richness.",87
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Atwater 2008 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Hints of smoke and wet stone combine with sweet Granny Smith apple and stonefruit aromas on the nose of this inviting dry Riesling. Smoke seeps through on the palate as well, melding with brighter flavors like orange peel and underripe tangerine, making for a refreshing yet deeply compelling sip.",87
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Atwater 2008 Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes),"Though richly perfumed with rose petals and elderflower, the flowery aromatics are reined in by bright lemon and citrus peel notes. The palate is plush and rich with flavors evocative of earl grey tea served with rose petal jam, with a gentle acidity to keep things fresh.",87
,Autonom 2007 Law of Proportions Syrah (California),"The components of this wine are all over the place, with blackberry and currant fruit, 100% new oak, brisk tannins and acidity needing to come together for harmony. Whether or not they will is a guess. Right now it's rustic, but dry and complex enough to drink after a good decant.",87
,Beringer 2007 Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Quite good and rich in jammy berry, cherry, cassis and oak flavors, but there's a certain obvious appeal that lacks complexity, and it's not what you expect from a wine of this reputation and price. This bottling has been falling off from the glories of the 1990s for some years now. A pity. Hopefully the trend will reverse. Production was 9,008 cases.",87
Michael Schachner,Bodegas Tarima 2009 Monastrell (Jumilla),"Rubbery and roasted, but not too much so. Otherwise one should look for medicinal berry aromas followed by flavors of baked plum, prune and black pepper. The finish is dense, a touch flat, and chocolaty; overall this is a chunky, sweet performer.",87
Joe Czerwinski,Château Grande Cassagne 2008 Grenache-Syrah (Costières de Nîmes),"A blend of 60% Grenache and 40% Syrah, this is another example of the fine values coming out of the Costières de Nîmes. It's a medium-bodied wine with a velvety texture and a fine balance between herbs and raspberry fruit on the one hand and dark berries and earth on the other. Drink it over the next 2–3 years.",87
,Cono Sur 2009 Visión Gewürztraminer (Casablanca Valley),"A highly aromatic wine. Lychee is the prime scent along with white flowers, and the palate is oily but right, with lychee, ginger, spice and orange flavors. Plump but short on the finish, but clean as a whole. Very nice for Chilean Gewürz.",87
,Corteforte 2007 Podere Bertarole Ripassato  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore),"A drying mineral note of slate or graphite runs through the middle of this plush and rich red Ripassato wine from Valpolicella. Background notes of spice and cherry cola come through as well, especially in the mouth where the wine boats a soft, compact feel. Pair this wine with lamb or light beef dishes.",87
,Degani 2008 Cicilio  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso),"Ripasso Cicilio shines bright with personality and freshness. This territory-driven wine boasts clean aromas of berry fruit, light shadings of spice and a touch of sweet cinnamon. It's easy, crisp mouthfeel washes clean over the palate.",87
,Dierberg 2007 Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),"Very dense in the mouth and full-bodied, with a dry, soft feeling. Lots of toasty oak, too. Feels somewhat inert, but the delicious cherries, toast and spices make it a pleasant sipper.",87
Joe Czerwinski,Domaine Nicolas Boiron 2008 Red (Côtes du Rhône),"From the family behind Bosquet des Papes in Châteauneuf, this is a solid Côtes du Rhône, with modest tannins but decent structure and typical notes of leather, dried cherries, chocolate and cinnamon. Drink it over the next few years.",87
Michael Schachner,Dominio de Tares 2007 Baltos Mencía (Bierzo),"Beefy, stocky aromas also bring herb, tomato and berry notes. The palate is jumpy and slightly medicinal, with currant, tomato, herb and plum flavors running the show. Medium in size, with level tannins and a juicy, good overall feel to it.",87
Michael Schachner,Finca Allende 2008 Blanco White (Rioja),"Yellow-gold in color, with baked fruit, butterscotch, creamed corn and wood resin aromas. Forcefully oaked and massive in the mouth, with enough sporty acidity to prop up the woodspice, nutmeg and resiny flavors that render the fruit secondary. Much like chewing on an oak plank, structured and layered.",87
Michael Schachner,Genium Celler 2006 Ecològic Red (Priorat),"Slightly fiery and hot on the nose, but there's enough berry, cherry and dusty leather to keep it positive. The palate is more sheer and sharp than expected, with piercing raspberry, razor's edge acidity and only a touch of back-end sweetness. Juicy but short and searing.",87
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Highland Cellars 2007 Oughterson Family Estates Riesling (Seneca Lake),"This late-release Riesling from Seneca Lake wafts with the delicate perfume of sweet peas, ripe stonefruits and a petrol undertone. Dry, but with a touch of white peach sweetness, refreshing lime juice flavors and a high toned acidity keep this wine refreshing and brisk.",87
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Keuka Lake Vineyards 2008 Falling Man Vineyard Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),"Dry and refreshing with clean, pure notes of white peach, orange blossoms and petrol on the nose and palate, this shows off Riesling's pristine side. A splash of tart, underripe starfruit and fresh limes on the palate combine with a brisk acidity and wet stone minerality, giving this wine an invigorating feel.",87
Michael Schachner,Korta 2009 Viognier-Sauvignon Blanc-Chardonnay White (Lontué Valley),"A lively, surprising bargain made from Viognier, Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay. That it costs merely $8 makes the melon and apple aromas and flavors all the better. Citrusy as it evolves, and clean throughout, with no wavering. A very nice white quaffing wine.",87
,Luigi Righetti 2007 Capitel de' Roari  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),"Amarone Capitel de' Roari delivers a crisp, lean expression that showcases Valpolicella winemaking tradition. The only out-of-place elements are the oak shadings that comes across as toasted nut, leather and dried tobacco.",87
Kerin O’Keefe,Francesco Rinaldi 2013 Cannubi  (Barolo),"New leather, pressed rose, violet, baking spice and crushed herb are just some of the aromas you'll find in this textbook Barolo. Firm yet loaded with finesse, the palate offers red cherry, strawberry compote, cinnamon and clove notes set against a backdrop of youthfully austere tannins and bright acidity. A licorice note lingers on the finish. Give it time to fully bloom. Drink 2023–2033.",94
Sean P. Sullivan,No Girls 2014 La Paciencia Vineyard Grenache (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),"Quite light in color, the aromas bring initially locked up but then broadly expansive notes of peat, green olive, white pepper, strawberry, Stargazer lilies, mineral and herb, showing a lot of complexity. The palate is textured, bringing a profound mixture of fruit and savory flavors that intertwine effortlessly on the long finish. It brings a sense of tension, texture and finesse that is completely captivating.",94
Matt Kettmann,Orfila 2014 Sequestered Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Hearty aromas of black cherry and mulberry meet with rustic iron, dark spice, crushed slate and dried sagebrush on the expertly woven nose of this bottling by a Southern California-based vintner. The palate balances bright acidity with upright tannins, allowing the dark-red fruit and mace spice flavors to shine.",94
Virginie Boone,Saintsbury 2015 Stanly Ranch Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Juicy and stemmy, this is a big, bold wine, explosive in highlights of huckleberry, dark cherry and forest floor. With firm tannins for days, it offers enviable length and spice along a smooth grippy texture and forceful complexity.",94
Virginie Boone,Sheldon 2016 Springloaded Monkey Paw Luc's Vineyard Tempranillo (Sonoma County),"And now for something completely different, this wine explodes in whole-cluster, carbonic freshness and surprise. It's a light cerebral take on the variety that delights at every turn. Stainless-steel fermented and aged, it's loaded in raspberry and cherry-jam flavors and dipped in black licorice. It's fresh, fruity and entirely memorable.",94
Joe Czerwinski,Te Mata 2014 Coleraine Red (Hawke's Bay),"The 2014 Coleraine is a blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 28% Merlot and 12% Cabernet Franc. Some herbal, cabbagey notes blow off with air to reveal vanilla, cedar, cassis, blackberry and mocha. Full bodied and plush, this wine is soft enough to drink now, but could probably go 20-plus years.",94
Michael Schachner,Trapiche 2012 Terroir Series Finca Ambrosia Single Vineyard Malbec (Uco Valley),"Saturated in color as well as on the nose, this fruit-packed Malbec opens with grapy black-plum and cassis aromas. An intensely bold palate is loaded to the hilt with black cherry, blackberry and integrated oak and spice flavors. A lush, steady finish unfolds in due time and with no disparate parts; drink from 2019–2025.",94
Kerin O’Keefe,Boffa 2014 Ovello  (Barbaresco),"This enticing and alluring wine opens with lovely crushed mint, new leather, iris and culinary spice aromas. The savory palate shows juicy Marasca cherry, ripe raspberry, cinnamon and pink peppercorn flavors while firm, refined tannins and fresh acidity provide balance and structure. A licorice note accents the finish.",94
Kerin O’Keefe,Brezza 2013 Castellero  (Barolo),"Violet, iris, perfumed berry, pine forest and baking spice aromas mingle in this fragrant, precise wine. The linear, focused palate offers cranberry, pomegranate, licorice and white pepper flavors alongside a backbone of vibrant acidity and youthfully austere tannins. Give it time to fully come together. Drink 2023–2043.",94
Kerin O’Keefe,Curto Marco 2013 La Foia  (Barolo),"This wine's new leather forest floor, menthol, pressed rose and exotic spice scents emerge in the glass. Full-bodied and focused, the palate delivers layers of cherry, pomegranate, crushed herb, licorice and cinnamon flavors. Bright acidity and youthful tannins provide balance and an ageworthy structure. Drink 2023–2038.",94
Paul Gregutt,Domaine Drouhin 2015 Édition Limitée Chardonnay (Dundee Hills),"Domaine Drouhin's reserve-level Chardonnay puts new oak flavors front and center but backs them up with ultraripe fruit. A lush mix of tangerine, melon and peach notes combine, expanding across the palate. It's drinking quite well already but should continue improve through 2024.",94
Virginie Boone,Saintsbury 2015 Pratt Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Spicy, seductive and stemmy, this wine from the coveted vineyard site is a celebration of baked rhubarb and cranberry. Velvety on the palate and boldly ripe and rich, it offers highlights of spicy black tea and cardamom that complements and complicates the fruit.",94
Kerin O’Keefe,Mauro Veglio 2013 Gattera  (Barolo),"Dark-skinned berry, exotic spice, blue flower and wild herb aromas take center stage in this Barolo. Full-bodied and loaded with finesse, the taut, precise palate offers juicy red cherry, cranberry, star anise and clove flavors framed by firm, fine-grained tannins and vibrant acidity. Drink 2023–2033.",94
Kerin O’Keefe,Mirafiore 2013 Paiagallo  (Barolo),"New leather, dark berry, fragrant blue flower, rose and baking spice aromas take shape in the glass. The smooth, delicious palate doles out juicy raspberry, crushed black cherry, star anise and cinnamon flavors, with polished tannins and bright acidity. Drink 2023–2033.",94
Roger Voss,Domaine Laporte 2016 Le Rochoy  (Sancerre),"From a sloping flinty vineyard, this is an impressive wine. It is powered by its tight tense texture to give a concentrated essence of Sauvignon Blanc. The wine, with its green and citrus fruits, is tangy, steely and needing to age. Drink from 2019.",94
Michael Schachner,El Esteco 2013 Chañar Punco Red (Calchaquí Valley),"This single-vineyard Malbec blend from vineyards that sit at 6,500 feet smells dark, grilled and rubbery, but also meaty and full of fruit. A full, lush palate avoids fierceness and lays on the richness. Toasty, lightly herbal berry and plum flavors are highly appealing. The wine tastes of herbs, salted meat and spices on a complex finish. Drink through 2024.",94
Virginie Boone,Elyse 2012 York Creek Vineyard Petite Sirah (Spring Mountain District),"This is from a tremendous vineyard site near the top of the appellation, situated from 1,250 to 1,800 feet. It incorporates small additions of Zinfandel and Carignane into the whole, a picture of soft beguiling violet aromas that are followed by a velvety texture and underlying grip of tannin. Rich red fruit and a taste of licorice linger on the intense finish.",94
Roger Voss,Henri Bourgeois 2014 Etienne Henri  (Sancerre),"Named after an ancestor who pioneered using oak barrels for maturing Sauvignon Blanc, the wine is, of course, wood aged. It is also ripe with yellow fruits, spice and vanilla. Apricot is cut with more tangy orange zest and finished with acidity. This is a concentrated wine that is just ready to drink.",94
Paul Gregutt,Bergström 2015 Sigrid Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"This succulent wine is saturated with rich citrus flavors. Grapefruit, lemon, lime and pineapple notes combine while its 18 months in barrel contributes a layer of buttery toast.",94
Paul Gregutt,Bethel Heights 2014 The High Wire Estate Chardonnay (Eola-Amity Hills),"The debut vintage for this cuvée, this is made from 100% Wente clone vines planted in 1977. It's richly concented on the palate, layered with dried apricot, grapefruit and pineapple flavors. A lush, buttery note enwraps its long, satisfying, full-bodied finish.",94
Michael Schachner,Bodega Catena Zapata 2013 Nicolas Catena Zapata Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec (Mendoza),"Generous oak is reflected via aromas of hickory and smoke on the nose of this lusty but refined blend of Cabernet and Malbec. In the mouth, rugged tannins and high acidity suggest further cellaring. Flavors of plum, berry, chocolate and tomato sauce finish with dry, pulling tannins and a sense of acidic freshness. Drink through 2027.",94
Virginie Boone,Carlisle 2015 Limerick Lane Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"Floral and surprisingly bright, this wine is driven by sharply etched acidity and citrus—its flavors balanced and complementary. Red cherry and raspberry find companionship in seasonings of cinnamon and clove, the texture slightly leathery and bold.",94
Virginie Boone,Carlisle 2015 Papa's Block Syrah (Russian River Valley),"Meaty in wild berry and leather, this is a high-toned wine with a gritty texture that evolves to become velvety in the glass. Generously ripe and rich in body, it's intense and fresh in equal measure, showing a complement of balanced brawn and beauty.",94
Virginie Boone,Carlisle 2015 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"Big and juicy, this wine draws on a few sources as well as 15% Petite Sirah to offer a complex and layered expression of black cherry, cardamom and chocolate. Rich from start to finish, it satisfies as it calls out for smoky meat.",94
Roger Voss,Casa Anadia 2013 Palácio Anadia Reserva Touriga Nacional (Dão),"Portugal's native Touriga Nacional originally comes from the Dão and this wine shows it in its glory. Planted around an ornate 16th-century palace, the vines have produced a richly structured wine, still showing some signs of wood aging. It is concentrated, with ripe red-cherry and blackberry fruits, solid tannins and acidity. Drink this wine from 2020.",94
Roger Voss,Casca Wines 2012 Monte Cascas Vinha das Cardosas Red (Bairrada),"This is a mature, single-vineyard wine. Beautifully perfumed, it includes, unusually, a small percentage of white grapes (historically a field blend) that soften the tannins of the 90% Baga. The wine is spicy, concentrated, dense with black fruits and tannins. It is ready to drink.",94
Roger Voss,Daniel Chotard 2015 Les Cris  (Sancerre),"This is a limited production wine from small parcels of limestone soil. Aged in acacia barrels, it has subtle spice and toast flavors. They wood aging has had the effect of broadening the wine and giving it extra richness. It's an impressive wine, ready to drink from 2018.",94
Roger Voss,Domaine Bernard Fleuriet et Fils 2015 Pur Jus  (Sancerre),"This wine has no added sulfur, giving crisp, clear and clean fruitiness. It also adds an light touch of oxidation that broadens the wine and makes the white stone fruit richer. Drink this impressively ripe wine from 2018.",94
Roger Voss,Quinta dos Murças 2015 Vintage  (Port),"This is very dense, with concentrated, dusty tannins and powerful blackberry flavors. It is rich and full of blackberry fruits along with acidity and a beautiful perfumed aftertaste. Drink from 2027.",94
Roger Voss,Château Dassault 2006 Barrel sample  (Saint-Émilion),"88—90 Barrel sample. The man who makes Dassault aeroplanes, also owns this property. It's improving, as witnessed by this dense, dark wine, very solid, dark chocolate.",89
Roger Voss,Château Rahoul 2006 Barrel sample  (Graves),"88—90 Barrel sample. A spicy, wood laden wine, kept afloat with ripe blackberries and fresh tannins. Excellent acidity to keep the wine buoyant.",89
Roger Voss,Alter Ego de Palmer 2008 Barrel sample  (Margaux),"88-90 Barrel sample. The second wine of Château Palmer is light, fresh and fruity, with accessible blackcurrant fruits. There is a light touch of wood, with delicious, easy juicy acidity.",89
Roger Voss,Château Fontenil 2008 Barrel sample  (Fronsac),"88-90 Barrel sample. Perfumed, light, hinting at minerality, the wine has a smooth veneer over the dusty tannins. The final effect is rich and polished.",89
Roger Voss,Château Kirwan 2008 Barrel sample  (Margaux),"88-90 Barrel sample. Caramel new wood aromas are followed by spice and toast flavors. The fruit seems thin by comparison, hard to feel under all that polished toast.",89
Roger Voss,Château Latour-Martillac 2008 Barrel sample  (Pessac-Léognan),"88-90 Barrel sample. A dark hued wine, with its tense tannins giving a strong backbone to the dry, firm structure. The fruit hardly shows through all this dry, extracted character.",89
,Vietti 2003 Tre Vigne  (Barbera d'Asti),"Representing four generations of winemaking, Vietti makes a strong show with this intense and vibrant ruby colored wine. Layers of toast, coffee and ripe red fruit reveal themselves to the nose with deep spice and clove that last long on the palate. This wine boasts solid structure and power.",89
Roger Voss,Château Bourgneuf-Vayron 2006 Barrel sample  (Pomerol),"88—90 Barrel sample. A wine with a high wood content, maybe too much – the question is over the fruit's ability to stand up to the blast of wood. The result is a wine that is super-spicy.",89
Roger Voss,Château Haut-Bergey 2006 Barrel sample  (Pessac-Léognan),"88—90 Barrel sample. Firm and dry, here is a wine that still offers plenty of ripe fruits. There are good blackcurrant flavors, along with the dry tannins that are as much wood as fruit driven.",89
Roger Voss,Château Lafleur-Gazin 2006 Barrel sample  (Pomerol),"88—90 Barrel sample. Somewhat lean, more of solid tannin than fruit. But there is also some fresh acidity.",89
Susan Kostrzewa,Backsberg 2003 Babylons Toren Red (Paarl),"This blend features aromas of vanilla, sweet tobacco and cherry followed by big, masculine flavors of cassis, raspberry, tobacco and cedar. Deep spice undertones add to the dimension of the wine. Ageable and intense and best paired with more robust meat dishes.",89
Michael Schachner,Pulenta Estate 2008 La Flor Malbec (Mendoza),"Bold and earthy wine, with aromas of fine rubber, balsam wood, forest floor, spice and ripe black fruit. It's thick as it rolls over the palate, and the wild berry, herb and pepper flavors fit the wine's physique and profile. Long and fairly deep on the finish; drink now through 2011.",89
Susan Kostrzewa,Stark-Condé 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Stellenbosch),"This is an interesting Cabernet because of its balance of rich, plush fruit and exotic, plucky spice. The nose offers cloves, pepper and mocha, and on the palate, flavors of smoke, cracked pepper and plum are inviting. A stylish sip with aging potential.",89
Roger Voss,Château Bouscaut 2006 Barrel sample  (Pessac-Léognan),"88—90 Barrel sample. Very sweet, ripe, rounded, with almost tropical richness, layered with lychees and spice.",89

Roger Voss,Château Smith Haut Lafitte 2006 Barrel sample  (Pessac-Léognan),"88—90 Barrel sample. Sweet, soft, ripe, full of very soft fruit flavors. The ripeness of the year seems to have overtaken the wine.",89
Roger Voss,Château Bastor-Lamontagne 2008 Barrel Sample  (Sauternes),"88-90 Barrel sample. A light style, moving into delicate citrus and crisp fruits. It shows a lively palate, with a tight, dry core of botrytis.",89
Roger Voss,Château Croizet-Bages 2008 Barrel sample  (Pauillac),"88-90 Barrel sample. A ripe, fruity wine, showing delicious fresh berries, lively acidity over solid tannins. This is a wine on the charming side, maybe lacking intensity, but a pleasure to taste.",89
Roger Voss,Château Ferrière 2008 Barrel sample  (Margaux),"88-90 Barrel sample. With its minty aroma and high proportion of new wood, this is a wine which shows polish, a smooth, wood-laden texture offering a wine that will probably age quickly.",89
,Klinker Brick 2007 Farráh Syrah (Lodi),"There are delicious flavors in this ripe Syrah, and while it's too soft for comfort, it sure is nice to drink. Offers waves of blackberries, mocha, black pepper and smoky sandalwood that finish thoroughly dry and complex in Asian spices.",89
Paul Gregutt,Tildio 2006 Cabernet Franc (Wahluke Slope),"A proven success for Tildio, the newest release of Cabernet Franc uses fruit from the exceptional RiverBend vineyard in the Wahluke Slope. It's a delicious mix of wild berry and smoky earth, with dark streaks of licorice and tar adding depth and persistence.",89
,42°S NV Brut Méthode Traditionelle Sparkling Wine  (Tasmania),"Delicate and light-bodied with plenty to love in the nose, including irresistible notes of bread dough, strawberry and lemon which turn to fresh cherries in the mouth. The finish is focused and very crisp—just a few paces short of tart, actually. This wine screams for raw oysters.",89
Virginie Boone,Pine & Brown 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"Three vineyards contribute to this lovely wine, two in Rutherford, both certified organic, and another in Soda Canyon which is at 800-feet in elevation. Red and blue fruit open for leather and a touch of cedar and dried herb—the wine ultimately elegant and Old World. The tannin weight is substantial but never distracting.",91
Matt Kettmann,Point & Line 2014 Vogelzang Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),"Quite light in aroma at first, this is a delicate, lithe and lovely bottling, showing lemon and yellow pear tones on the nose. That sensibility carries to the palate, where touches of yellow apple, sea salt, faint banana and a shred of bubblegum converge for a complete yet restrained white wine experience.",91
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Schloss Johannisberger 2014 Rotlack Kabinett Feinherb Riesling (Rheingau),"Fresh grapefruit, lime and lemon collide in this invigorating waterfall of citrus flavors. Off dry in style and breathlessly light in texture, it hits the palate with an electric edge of acidity that reverberates through a long finish. Drink now through 2024.",91
Virginie Boone,Sequoia Grove 2012 Cambium Red (Napa Valley),"The producer's flagship wine, this vintage blends Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Dry tannins provide a leathery texture atop piquant sensibilities of cedar, pencil and chocolate-specked blackberry jam. Structured and full bodied, it'll benefit from further cellaring. Drink now through 2022.",91
Jim Gordon,Skinner 2013 Mourvèdre (El Dorado),"Different and intriguing, this tightly wound wine has white pepper aromas, tart cherry and raspberry flavors and an engaging, astringent mouthfeel. High in acidity and relatively low in body, it has a vibrancy and restraint that will benefit from more time in the bottle. Best after 2019.",91
Paul Gregutt,Sokol Blosser 2013 Goosepen Block Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Single block wines, such as this one, often show a tight focus rather than a broad palate. Here it works well, wrapping savory notes around red currant fruit. There's a lightly metallic ring to the flavors, running straight through the finish. Give this a few hours of decanting, or tuck it away for drinking after 2020.",91
Virginie Boone,Gros Ventre 2013 Baranoff Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Farmed by the vineyard manager who owns Small Vines, another small Pinot Noir producer, this is a complex, well-crafted wine, high in acidity and high-toned red fruit, like cranberry, pomegranate and cherry, with a wisp of orange peel on their heels. Light-bodied, it finishes with black tea and mushrooms fighting for attention.",91
Jim Gordon,Hawk and Horse Vineyards 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Hills Lake County),"This wine has bold aromas of wood smoke and vanilla, a very firm, fine-grained and tannic texture, and lots of black cherry and dark plum flavors. It's a big, robust wine—pour alongside hefty proteins and settle back for the evening.",91
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Joh. Jos. Prüm 2014 Wehlener Sonnenuhr Spätlese Riesling (Mosel),"While subdued and closed off at initial tasting, time and aeration seem to bring out this wine's vibrant tangerine and apricot perfume. The spry palate is delicately sweet, juxtaposing fresh, primary stone fruit and lime flavors against a backdrop of savory earth and nut. It's a quiet wine that should gain power and depth with maturity. Hold until 2020.",91
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Johannishof 2014 Rüdesheimer Berg Rottland Spätlese Riesling (Rheingau),"Pristine, primary tangerine and grapefruit flavors shine brilliantly throughout this crisp, light-footed Spätlese. It's dangerously quaffable, yet nuanced by shades of candlewax, mineral and saffron that extend the finish dramatically.",91
Paul Gregutt,King Estate 2014 Antiquum Vineyards Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),"Refined and complex, this limited-production, vineyard-designate wine starts with lemony acidity, but there's much more to discover as it bores down through the palate. Meyer lemons, grapefruit and nectarines are in the mix, with refreshing minerality.",91
Virginie Boone,Kokomo 2015 Grenache Rosé (North Coast),"Pretty in jasmine, lemon and orange, this is a crisp, dry and lovely wine, integrated with just enough heft on the body and a surprisingly deft length on the finish. Stock up for gatherings.",91
Michael Schachner,Palacios Remondo 2011 Propiedad  (Rioja),"Closed and in need of air at first, this takes on a ripe, medicinal, almost candied red-fruit nose. Next up is a full, wide-bodied palate with chunky plum and raspberry flavors. This old-vines Garnacha is ripe, tasty and all about the fruit. Drink through 2020.",91
Virginie Boone,Lang & Reed 2013 Two-Fourteen Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley),"Named for a Loire Valley clone, this New World wine aspires to an Old World sensibility and achieves it in its floral invitation and bright, peppery overtones. Coiled within its thickness of tannin and dense cherry are ethereal, earthy whispers of intrigue and acidity. This is a lively, lovely wine.",91
Matt Kettmann,Lucienne 2013 Lone Oak Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Clean aromas of honeysuckle converge with richer, rounded components of Asian pear, coconut and pineapple on the nose of this single vineyard expression. There's a caramel touch at the tip of the rich sip, with layers of brown spice, yellow fruit and rocky earth.",91
Virginie Boone,MacPhail 2013 The Flyer Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Let this burly, big-boned beauty open to fully enjoy its robust oak and fistfuls of black cherry, the oak showing in terms of toasty, slightly reductive aromas. A smooth texture keeps the wine flowing along a concentrated highway of power and ripeness.",91
Jim Gordon,Michael David 2013 Freakshow Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi),"This wine is a bold but well-mannered blockbuster that serves generous helpings of dark color, spicy aromas, concentrated flavors and a luxurious dry texture. It needs full-flavored, rich food to accompany it, and will deliver a lot of pleasure under those circumstances. Best to drink now through 2020.",91
Jim Gordon,Navarro 2014 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"This medium-bodied wine has a compelling blend of restraint and power. It offers modest, fruity aromas at first, then nice tart fruit flavors that start off lean and soon expand exponentially in the mouth before tapering off elegantly on the finish. With little oak flavor in the way, it gives pure Pinot sophistication.",91
Jim Gordon,Occasio 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley),"This wine is agile and elegant, very firm in texture without being too full-bodied. It smells lightly smoky, slightly herbal and tastes moderately rich as subtle plum and pomegranate flavors transition to richer berry and cocoa notes on the finish. It needs time to show more complexity, so drink after 2020.",91
Matt Kettmann,Pali 2014 Huntington Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),"Another stunning deal on this annual bottling, this wine is jammy and fruity on the nose with buttered cherries and berry jam, yet layered with baking spice and wet clay minerality. Dried strawberries, black cherries and plums show on the palate, enhanced by a toasted clove, graphite, juniper and forest floor mintiness.",91
Matt Kettmann,Pear Valley 2013 Distraction Red (Paso Robles),"The signature bottling from this winery, this very dark blend of 57% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Petit Verdot, 13% Malbec, 8% Merlot and 5% Cabernet Franc offers deep black plum and black currant as well as cigar box, smoked beef and caramel on the nose. A blackberry-purée flavor leads the very fruit-driven palate, which is bolstered by black pepper, violet, shaved dark chocolate and espresso bean.",91
Jim Gordon,Renwood 2013 Riker Vineyard Zinfandel (Amador County),"This wine has jazzy, jammy aromas and ripe blackberry and strawberry flavors, wrapping them in a warm layer of fine-grained tannins and a nice dash of sweet baking spices from aging in oak.",91
Michael Schachner,San Pedro 2013 1865 Limited Edition Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah (Cachapoal Valley),"Aromas of Italian herbs like basil and oregano blend with eucalyptus and black-fruit scents. Chunky, clampy, bumpy tannins define the mouthfeel on this Cab-Syrah blend, while roasted flavors of plum, berry and chocolate finish herbal, meaty and warm. Drink through 2020.",91
Matt Kettmann,Soquel Vineyards 2013 Library Selection Estate Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Rounded strawberry, orange peel, tart black raspberry and a touch of juniper pop on the nose of this appellation blend by members of the pioneering Bargetto family. Black plum skins, crushed slate, raspberry juice and fresh-picked thyme show on the palate.",91
Virginie Boone,Starmont 2015 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Floral, pretty and light, this wine was made for porch sitting and all-around relaxing. It never gives up on fruit and complexity, offering a medium body and vibrant acidity around the rose-petaled texture. This is a lovely sipper.",91
Matt Kettmann,Stephen Ross 2015 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),"The slightest shade of yellowish pink, this wine is a great study of fresh acidity and compelling texture in a rosé. Very slight and soft strawberry and squeezed lemon aromas kick off the experience, followed by light red fruit sliced by tangy kumquat on the palate. The flavors are not particularly complex or unique, but the sip is fascinating.",91
Paul Gregutt,Stoller 2015 Pinot Noir Rosé (Dundee Hills),"Though pale in hue, this is big in flavor. It's a textbook Pinot Noir rosé, sharp, tight and showing deep flavors of rhubarb, rosewater and strawberry fruit. There's exceptional length along with the lovely, fresh fruit flavors.",91
Virginie Boone,Stonehedge 2014 Reserve Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"This is a lovely, full-bodied expression of apple blossom aromas, just-ripe pear and orange Creamsicle, a balanced mix of rich and sublime that remains smooth and silky on the palate with a lingering finish.",91
Michael Schachner,Bodegas Landaluce 2012 Fincas Landaluce Crianza  (Rioja),"Fresh, pure berry aromas don't mess around. This fruit-forward Crianza is mouth-filling and borders on lush. Flavors of black cherry, blackberry, pepper and spice finish solid as a rock, with length and a confirming sense of quality.",91
Michael Schachner,Bodegas Palacio 2012 Cosme Palacio Vendimia Seleccionada  (Rioja),"This Crianza is strapping on the nose, with fairly big but not overdone black-fruit aromas. A ripe, chewy palate with moderate tannins holds peppery wild berry flavors that settle on plum. A dark, toasty, peppery finish is mild and smooth. Overall, this offers a lot to like.",91
Roger Voss,Benoît Daridan 2014 Pinot Noir-Gamay (Cheverny),"Dominated by Pinot Noir, this is a tight and stalky wine. It is almost too light, with its acidity and tight tannins to the front. Probably as it softens it will round out, so wait until late 2016 to drink.",87
Roger Voss,Benoît Daridan 2014 Rosé (Cheverny),"Made from Pinot Noir, this fresh and light rosé is packed with red berries and lively acidity. It is perfumed, dry and very fruity. Drink now.",87
Roger Voss,Campolargo 2013 Vinha do Putto Branco White (Bairrada),"A full ripe and refreshingly fruity wine, this is full of grapefruit, apricot and ripe pear flavors. It has a touch of spice and a firmly mineral character. Drink now.",87
Paul Gregutt,Coeur de Terre 2013 Oregon Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Scents softly suggest rose petals and milk chocolate, leading into a wine that seems to hit a hard stop midpalate. A clear flavor of cold steel resonates against a counterpoint of tart berry fruit.",87
Paul Gregutt,Cummins Road 2012 Pinot Noir,"A hint of sweat in the nose blows away to reveal a solid core of cherry fruit, along with broad flavors of stem, coffee and earth. This wine is substantial, though that slightly funky character lingers into the finish.",87
Kerin O’Keefe,Il Falchetto 2013 Bricco Paradiso  (Barbera d'Asti Superiore),"Warm and full-bodied, this opens with aromas of espresso, fig, dried berry, toasted oak and clove. The dense palate offers raisin, oak, roasted coffee bean and spearmint alongside round tannins. You'll also notice the heat of evident alcohol.",87
Kerin O’Keefe,La Fusina 2013  Dogliani Superiore,"Aromas of crushed dark-skinned berry, violet, clove and a hint of chopped herb lead the nose. The lean palate offers raw raspberry, sour cherry and ground pepper alongside firm tannins. A note of bitter walnut closes the finish.",87
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Leonard Kreusch 2014 Piesporter Goldtröpfchen Kabinett Riesling (Mosel),"Saffron and orange blossoms perfume this intensely ripe, almost honey-slick Kabinett. There's a zesty backbone of tangerine acidity, but the palate is a crush of ruddy yellow peach and nectarine flavors. It's a luscious, forward wine to enjoy young.",87
Michael Schachner,Luigi Bosca 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),"Crisp almost scratchy aromas of herbal red fruits are a bit strained. This feels solid, with ample volume. Earthy flavors of tomato sauce, mixed spices, stewed plum and cassis finish long and herbal, with some grace.",87
Kerin O’Keefe,Monchiero Carbone 2011 Printi Riserva  (Roero),"French oak, vanilla, coconut, menthol and berry aromas lead the nose and carry over to the bracing palate along with close-grained tannins that leave a rather astringent finish.",87
Kerin O’Keefe,Montalbera 2014 La Ribelle  (Barbera d'Asti),"Aromas of dried berry, plum, rose and underbrush lead the nose. The easygoing palate offers raisin, blackberry jam, walnut and black pepper. Enjoy through 2017.",87
Michael Schachner,Raiza 2013 Crianza  (Rioja),"Aromas of Middle Eastern spices, pencil eraser, oak grain, red plum and cherry make for a complete nose. This Tempranillo offers good body and a fair amount of oak on the palate along with spicy plum fruit that tastes more oaky and lactic on the finish.",87
Virginie Boone,Mount Veeder 2012 Reserve Red (Mount Veeder),"This wine is made from a majority of Cabernet Sauvignon, with tiny additions of Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot. A minty, menthol streak is strong on the nose, veering into almost eucalyptus, while dried herb and a shot of gunpowder provide additional savory aromas and flavors. Big tannins need time in the glass to mellow.",87
Kerin O’Keefe,Paolo Manzone 2013 Fiorenza Cascina Meriame  (Barbera d'Alba Superiore),"Toasted oak, coconut, espresso and exotic spice aromas come together in the glass. The firm palate offers blackberry, licorice and oak-driven spice alongside grainy tannins and brisk acidity.",87
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Peter Nicolay 2014 Riesling (Mosel),"While a touch brambly on the nose, ripe rich tangerine and yellow plum flavors take the spotlight in this sunny off-dry Riesling. It's plush on the palate but pleasant, accessible and forward. Drink now.",87
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Peter Nicolay 2014 Ürziger Goldwingert Spätlese Riesling (Mosel),"Slightly oxidized tones of pressed apple and pear are lifted by a shock of lemony acidity in this spry semi-dry Riesling. The tangerine palate extends moderately long, encouraged by a swathe of dried herb notes.",87
Kerin O’Keefe,Podere Ruggeri Corsini 2012 Armujan  (Barbera d'Alba),"Aromas of mature plum, espresso, coconut and toasted oak lead the nose. The firm palate offers fig, blackberry jam, licorice and roasted coffee bean alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. The fruit is starting to dry up so drink sooner rather than later.",87
Roger Voss,Quinta Nova de Nossa Senhora do Carmo 2011 Pomares Red (Douro),This is a solid mineral and tannin dominated wine. It has black currant fruits which are still buried by the tense tannins and stalky texture. It therefore needs some time to develop and broaden out. Drink from 2018.,87
Virginie Boone,Rodney Strong 2014 Rosé of Malbec (Sonoma County),"This wine comes from Alexander Valley-grown Malbec, a variety the producer has been planting in earnest over the last few years. Dark pink-red, it is medium bodied and refreshing, with notes of cherry, blueberry and vanilla.",87
Paul Gregutt,Silvan Ridge 2013 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Anchored in fig, plum and berry fruit, this is a substantial effort for both the vintage and the price. It will show best with hearty, cold-weather dishes. Hints of cinnamon and chocolate extend the finish.",87
Roger Voss,Terras de Alter 2014 Terra d'Alter Alvarinho (Alentejano),"A surprisingly fresh wine for an Alvarinho from the hot Alentejo. It shows crisp acidity, with lime and apricot flavors and a bright, crisp aftertaste.",87
Roger Voss,Terras de Alter 2014 Terra d'Alter White (Alentejano),"This is an attractive, perfumed wine that is a blend of Síria, Arinto and Viognier. It's the Viognier that gives the perfumed character that makes it so distinctive. It's fruity, lightly textured and ready to drink.",87
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Schmitt Söhne 2014 Relax Riesling (Mosel),"Freshly snipped thyme and bramble notes are prominent, yet unobtrusive against a backdrop of honey-kissed lemon and lime in this brisk off-dry Riesling. It's a zesty sprightly wine to drink young.",87
Joe Czerwinski,Shoofly 2014 Pinot Noir (Victoria),"Blended from Yarra Valley and King Valley fruit, this light-bodied Pinot Noir is silky in texture, with a lingering finish. Modest red fruit combines with earthier notes of parsnip. Drink now.",87
Mike DeSimone,Tabor 2014 Mt. Tabor Chardonnay (Galilee),"This wine has aromas of lemongrass and apricot with a touch of petrol. It offers flavors of peach, apricot, vanilla and jasmine. It is very soft in the mouth, and the bright finish is marked by floral notes.",87
Michael Schachner,Tiza 2013 Malbec (Uco Valley),"Earthy slightly grassy infusions work their way onto a hot energetic bouquet. This feels racy, drawing and a bit clampy, while woody spicy flavors of rubbery berry fruits finish bold and hot like the beginning.",87
Sean P. Sullivan,Larkspur 2013 Pinot Noir (Oregon),"Perfumed aromas of cherry, forest floor and cinnamon bring appeal to this light-colored wine. It's delicate and airy in style, with cranberry flavors on the finish.",87
Paul Gregutt,Ledger David 2013 Malbec (Rogue Valley),"This estate-grown effort is almost jet black, and scented with tar, smoke and black fruits. It's dense beyond dense, and completely shut down. Even after aeration, decanting, and hours of breathing time, it remained stubbornly closed. Brief hints of tobacco and earth, cassis and coffee suggest that with more bottle age, this one could really blossom.",87
Matt Kettmann,Liberated 2013 Pinot Noir (Monterey County),"Black cherry, chipped slate and an earthy nutmeg character show on the nose of this stylishly labeled bottling. Medium in weight, it offers energetic and tart cranberry-cherry flavors as well as a menthol element on the palate, which is tangy throughout and wipes up clean.",87
Roger Voss,Fiuza 2014 3 Castas Red (Tejo),"The wine is young, still more structure than fruit. It has firm tannins as well as juicy blackberry fruits. A blend of Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Touriga Nacional, it is likely to age for a few months, so drink from the end of 2016.",87
Paul Gregutt,Seven Hills 1997 Seven Hills Vineyard Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"An earthy, leathery, spicy nose dominates this 100% Cabernet from 17-year-old vines. This is an elegant, complex, earthy wine, beautifully balanced with classic cassis laced with leather, barnyard, coffee, smoke and spice. 180 cases made.",91
Paul Gregutt,Canoe Ridge 1998 Reserve Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A much more concentrated version of the regular bottling. The fruit is still raspberries and cherries, but there is more focus and power, and it’s wrapped in smooth milk chocolate. A flat-out delicious bottle of Merlot.",90
,Kunde 1998 C.S. Ridge Vineyard Chardonnay (California),"From the highest (at 1,000 feet) of the Kunde's vineyards, it's lavishly oaked, with aromas of butterscotch, spice and custard; also nutty and creamy notes. Marked by intense tropical fruit aromas and oriental spices, it also tastes very rich. It's the best of a very good trio of limited-production Chardonnay wines.",90
,Signorello 1998 Hope's Cuvée Chardonnay (California),"This massively oaky wine smells like an explosion in a spice factory, with ginger, cinnamon, clove and nutmeg aromas, accented by vanilla, brown sugar, butterscotch and honey. Somewhere in there is some ripe tropical fruit. Enormous and full-bodied, it's a dense, unctuous wine.",90
Paul Gregutt,Chateau Ste. Michelle 1997 Late Harvest Sémillon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Harvested at a lip-smacking 42.5° brix, this seductive wine explodes on the palate with bright grapefruit and citrus flavors, highlighted with sharp acids and finishing with lingering notes of caramel and butter. Long and delicious.",90
Paul Gregutt,Canoe Ridge 1999 Oak Ridge Vineyard Gewürztraminer (Washington),"The effusive, floral, fragrant nose opens into phenomenal tangerine and satsuma orange flavors, enlivened with spice and a wonderful, refreshing mouthfeel (from barrel fermentation). Best Buy.",90
,Château Souverain 1998 Winemaker's Reserve Chardonnay (California),"After you've had oceans of Chardonnay and don't think there's room for a drop more, along comes a wine like this to change your mind. It's not just the peach, pear and tropical fruit, or the honeyed, vanilla-scented buttered toast, or the oriental spices, or the clean acidity, or the rich, creamy texture. It's all of these together, in a balanced package.",90
Paul Gregutt,Columbia Winery 1998 Red Willow Vyd Sangiovese (Yakima Valley),"This David Lake Signature Series wine blends two different clones, Sangiovese Piccolo and Sangiovese Grosso, and starts with a lovely, complex bouquet of rose petals, strawberry, watermelon, cherry and cocoa. It's supple, elegant and graceful, with pretty accents and subtle spicy highlights nicely spaced across the palate. A delicate, sensuous wine.",90
,Kunde 1998 Reserve Chardonnay (Sonoma Valley),"A tremendously rich, oaky Chard that will blast your socks off and then some. The fruit is really complex, ranging from green apples to savory ripe peaches on into tropical fruit, and there's a dusty sprinkling of cinnamon and ginger. For sur-lie freaks, there's lots of creamy, yeasty, nutty notes contributing to this delicious, hard-hitting wine.",90
,Gainey 1998 Limited Selection Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),"This unusually rich wine has it all: ripe, round citrus and peach fruit compounded with oaky notes of vanilla, toast and butter. There's none of that grassy, straw character you find in so many North Coast offerings. With its fine, spicy finish, it's one of the best Sauvignon Blancs of the vintage. Contains 9% Sémillon.",90
Paul Gregutt,Andrew Will 1999 Ciel du Cheval Sangiovese (Yakima Valley),"This clear and bright cranberry-red wine sports a pungent nose with spice, cranberry, mocha and light cherry scents and flavors. Shows some interesting herbal nuances of thyme and oregano. Good focus in a fruit-forward style; tight and delicious with a pretty finish.",90
,Mirassou 1997 Harvest Reserve Merlot (California),"It's hard to ripen Bordeaux red varietals in Monterey, but this was a good vintage and Mirassou has some good vineyards. The fruit is scented with blackberries and plums and even deeper notes of chocolate, espresso, and smoked meat. There's also a generous dose of oak. It drinks fine and dry, and captures that magical quality of finesse and elegance despite its size, which is considerable. A plush, opulent wine.",90
Paul Gregutt,Seven Hills 1997 Klipsun Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The big, powerful nose showcases blackberry, plum and brambly components. This tight, tannic, nicely constructed, ageworthy Cabernet features dark licorice streaks running through the long finish.",90
Paul Gregutt,Woodward Canyon 1999 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Lovely, fruity wine, with ripe apples and peaches dominating. But there's also plenty of toasty new oak and roasted hazelnuts. Soft and approachable, with a bright, hot finish.",90
Paul Gregutt,Kiona 1999 Ice Wine Chenin Blanc (Yakima Valley),"Spice and melons illuminate the nose; the wine displays amazing concentration, with deep, syrupy peach and apricot fruit, and a bit of sugar and toasted coconut in the finish. Good acid balance. It's still very young, but immediately delicious.",90
,Bridlewood 1998 Winners Circle Syrah (Central Coast),"This represents the winery's attempt to recreate a Côte Rôtie-like wine. It's very similar to the regular bottling, with lots of ripe, fancy fruit, but it's oakier, with 50% new American barrels. What really distinguishes it, though, is its balance. The only complaint, and it's a minor one, is that the tannins are so soft, and the acidity so low, that it's a bit flabby. Most people won't notice or care.",90
,Louis M. Martini 1997 Merlot (Chiles Valley),"An exceptional wine from this historic producer. Very aromatic, with generous blueberry, chocolate, mint, mushroom, and sweet charred oak. Rich and full-bodied. The fruity ripeness is delicious and sweet. The mouthfeel is luscious and creamy, and it finishes with a slight tannic bite. Probably at its youthful best now.",90
,Robert Mondavi 1998 Sauvignon Blanc (Stags Leap District),"This wine needs food so much, it practically cries out loud for it. It's like the essence of lemons and grapefruits, in a bone-dry, crisply tart package that makes the taste buds sing. The oak has been kept in the background to emphasize the clean, racy flavors, although partial sur-lie aging adds creamy notes. Oysters and this wine would be a marriage made in heaven.",89
,Merryvale 1998 Silhouette Chardonnay (California),"They took only the best fruit they could find for this expensive wine, and made only 1,280 cases of it. Using every Burgundian trick in the book, winemaker Steve Test has created a rich, creamy wine, long on smoky oak and yeasty lees, with impressive spice and fruit that veers toward peaches and more tropical notes.",89
,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 1998 Beckstoffer Ranch Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"Bright, forward fruit and spice characterize this very rich, complex wine. The aromas veer toward banana and ripe peach and pear, with oriental spices, vanilla, and toast. In the mouth, the flavors are fruity, with a leesy streak. High acidity makes it a little sharp, while the texture is creamy. All in all, it's very balanced, except for that sharpness, which a year or two of aging should mellow.",89
,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 1998 Reserve Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"The aromas are similar to the above wine, maybe a little less forward and earthier, but still dominated by tropical fruit and oaky complexities. It drinks quite a bit softer, though, with lower acidity, which makes it seem richer, fatter, and more user friendly. You can taste the pretty fruit on the finish.",89
Paul Gregutt,Columbia Winery 1998 Otis Vineyard Chardonnay (Yakima Valley),"The lovely, lushly fruity nose features plenty of buttery, roasted walnut scents from new oak fermentation. Despite the oak, it retains its freshness and acid balance, keeping it lively through a long, toasty finish.",89
,Merryvale 1999 Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (California),"On one level this is a straightforward wine, varietally correct with lemony flavors. It's very dry and tart, with some nutty, oily nuances from 12% Sémillon. However, it has that undefinable something that makes it elegant and interesting. You find yourself reaching for it when richer, oakier, lusher wines pall.",89
Paul Gregutt,Seven Hills 1997 Seven Hills Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Blended with a small amount of Merlot (10%), this wine sends up a classic bouquet of cassis and berry, with a nice hint of mint. It’s well crafted, but tight and a little hard yet, especially in the finish. Built for aging.",89
Paul Gregutt,Seven Hills 1997 Seven Hills Vineyard Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Blueberries, plums, and especially cherries, with a lovely, soft, beguiling bouquet of rose blossoms and chocolate. Crisply structured, with tight fruit, soft tannins, and a medium-weight, extended finish.",89
,Schug 1997 Heritage Reserve Merlot (Carneros),"The aromas are much more closed and dense than the regular bottling. Airing reveals plum, currant and cinnamon, and a good dose of toasty oak. Thick and dense, with fine fruit, intricate tannins, and oak. Delicious now, but will gain complexity with short-term aging. Only 329 cases produced.",89
,Bridlewood 1998 Syrah (Paso Robles),"Dark, rich, and ultraripe yet balanced, this wine has plenty of charm. You can taste the warm California sunshine in each ripe sip. All kinds of wild berry and dark stone-fruit flavors mingle with spices and herbs, with a smoky, oaky overlay. Not great wine, but completely satisfying, and one that most will find lip-smackingly delicious.",89
,Eagle & Rose Estate 1998 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"A new wine from a new winery. It's actually from a warm easterly section of Napa, Pope Valley, that seems to coax honeydew and watermelon flavors from the grapes. The wine, which is very dry, has been given the royal treatment, with barrel fermentation and extended lees aging, so there's that lovely creamy mouthfeel; malolactic fermentation softens it even more. Pretty lush stuff from a winery to watch.",88
,Hoodsport 1998 Reserve Chardonnay (Yakima Valley),"Smells oakier and fruitier than the regular bottling, with pretty peach and green-apple notes. There's a fair amount of richness on the palate. The fruit is spicy and ripe, and the oak adds spice and a sappy sweetness. Very balanced and likable, and certainly a nice food wine.",88
Paul Gregutt,Columbia Winery 1998 Syrah (Yakima Valley),"Columbia's second-tier Syrah uses Red Willow fruit from young plantings. The wine has a lovely black-plum color, and it's softly scented with chocolate, pepper and berries. Youthful, vibrant and sharp-toned, with the tart fruit cloaked in smooth, chocolaty tannins.",88
Michael Schachner,Bodegas Valdemar 2007 Conde de Valdemar Reserva  (Rioja),"This is a textbook traditional Rioja, with dry spice, earth, light herbal notes and leather on the nose alongside cherry and plum scents. The palate is crisp, elegant and pure, with raspberry, vanilla, plum and leathery flavors. Modest complexity and elegance rise up on the finish. Drink through 2018.",90
,Cameron Hughes 2011 Lot 418 Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"Blackberry, black currant, cassis, blueberry, dark chocolate and oak flavors mark this dry, tannic Cabernet. It shows real Oakville character, at a good price. Gets better and better as it breathes in the glass. Drink now–2015.",90
Kerin O’Keefe,Il Poggione 2009  Brunello di Montalcino,"This forward Brunello opens with a fruit and spice fragrance of ripe black berries, cinnamon and hot red pepper. The dense palate delivers fleshy black cherry, ripe black raspberry, black pepper and cake spices alongside dusty tannins.",90
Anne Krebiehl MW,Juris 2011 Tricata Red (Weinland Österreich),"Inky, floral depth with the spice of French oak leads to a fullish but toned body full of dark elderberry and plum fruits. There's a dark, brooding subtext despite the obviously mellowing oak flavors and a core of spice that will fulfil its promise with some further time in bottle. The concentrated power here comes from partially dried grapes. The tannins are pliable and supple. Enjoy as of 2016.",90
Virginie Boone,Kale 2009 Alder Springs Vineyard Spirit Rock Syrah (Mendocino County),"Voluptuous and savory, this Syrah is blended with 10% Viognier and the aromatics benefit as a result, a minerally mix of floral raspberry and vanilla. Earthy and leathery on the palate, it shows a taste of baked plum on the finish, as well as tobacco, a nice balance between Syrah's darker and brighter sides.",90
Anne Krebiehl MW,Zull 2012 Innere Bergen Riesling (Niederösterreich),"Freshly cut green pears and crunchy, ripe apples have immediate appeal. This fruity freshness continues on the sleek and super-clean palate, which leads to a refreshing, long finish.",90
Roger Voss,Château La Garricq 2011  Moulis-en-Médoc,"From an eight-acre vineyard, this is produced by the same team as Château Paloumey. Powerful and concentrated, it is also elegant, balancing its structure with good berry fruits and acidity. The tannins are still considerable, so drink from 2017.",90
Roger Voss,Château l'Évangile 2011 Blason de l'Evangile  (Pomerol),"This is a delightfully perfumed wine, the second wine of Château L'Evangile. Smooth with ripe Merlot flavors, it's full and dense, conveying the sense that it will mature quickly. Drink from 2016.",90
Roger Voss,Château Saint-Estèphe 2011  Saint-Estèphe,"A firm, dense wine, it currently shows plenty of dry tannins along with potentially ripe fruits. Already showing balance, it is developing into a complex, rich wine that will be full of black fruits and smoother tannins. Drink from 2017.",90
Paul Gregutt,Coeur d'Alene 2012 Viognier (Washington),"Generous, sweetly perfumed aromas of melon and lemon oil lead into a wine with precision and penetration. Spicy, candied ginger complements the citrus and tropical fruit, and barrel fermentation gives it a gently buttery mouthfeel.",90
Kerin O’Keefe,Conti Costanti 2009  Brunello di Montalcino,"This wine shows real depth, beginning with earthy aromas of underbrush, ripe berried fruit, blue flower and smidge of leather. The palate offers a core of black cherry accented with notes of baking spices and a hint of truffle alongside a solid tannic backbone and nervous acidity that restrains the berry richness. Drink 2016–2024.",90
Kerin O’Keefe,Corte dei Venti 2009  Brunello di Montalcino,"This earthy Brunello leads with aromas of underbrush, mushroom, bay leaf, cherry and Mediterranean herbs. The palate offers juicy black cherry and ripe raspberry punctuated with cinnamon-spice, vanilla, mocha and licorice alongside smoothed but fleeting tannins. It's nicely crafted and boasts decent freshness for the vintage.",90
Paul Gregutt,DaMa 2011 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Sagemoor and Conner Lee grapes go into this soft, plush, totally drinkable Chardonnay. Pretty fruit flavors of banana, apple and pear mingle seamlessly, and the wine has both balance and texture to spare. Drink it now for its poise and freshness.",90
Michael Schachner,DiamAndes 2011 de Uco Malbec (Uco Valley),"Chunky, slightly rubbery aromas revolve around black fruits and oak. This is a dense, thick wine with blackberry, plum, fig and bitter chocolate flavors. The finish is dark and weighty in this meaty Malbec.",90
Michael Schachner,Emilio Moro 2010  Ribera del Duero,"Aromas of dried cheese, iodine and candied fruits settle with airing. In the mouth, this is firm and tannic, with savory, oaky flavors of hickory, blackened toast and roasted berry fruits. On the finish, there's both weight and elegance. Best from 2015 through 2020.",90
Kerin O’Keefe,Fattoria dei Barbi 2008 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),"This delivers a classic Sangiovese nose of wild cherry, leather, violet, iris, flint and spice. The dense palate reveals fleshy black cherry uplifted by menthol, eucalyptus, black pepper and sage. It's still young but should develop more complexity over the next few years. Drink 2016–2023.",90
Michael Schachner,Finca Lalande 2012 Made with organically grown grapes Malbec (Tupungato),"This wonderful under-$20 Malbec opens with a blast of black-fruit aromas as well as mild rubber scents and minerality. The palate is solid, with baked berry and integrated saline and mineral flavors. A bright, lively finish with a ton of berry essence closes this out.",90
Anne Krebiehl MW,Fritsch 2012 Mordthal Grüner Veltliner (Wagram-Donauland),"Subdued aromas of pear peel give way to fleshy pear fruit framed with grapefruit acidity. Harmonious and reined-in, the wine combines elegance with fruity concentration.",90
,Godspeed 2012 Estate Grown Chardonnay (Mount Veeder),"Chardonnays from Mount Veeder are rare, but the mountain can be a good home for that variety. Godspeed's 2012 is dry, brisk in acidity and enormously rich in tropical fruit, pear and apricot fruit flavors, enhanced with oak. Drink this Chard now with fancy fare, such as wild mushroom risotto, ahi tuna tartare and chicken lasagna.",90
Anne Krebiehl MW,Gross 2012 Sulz Sauvignon Blanc (Südsteiermark),"Lovely restraint and a soft, pliable creamy core on this concentrated wine that boasts buffered acidity as clear and pretty as a bell.",90
,Rodney Strong 2012 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This food-friendly Pinot Noir has a light body, dryness and crisp acidity that make it easy to pair with steaks, chops, salmon, mushroom risotto and similar fare. There's nothing shy, however, about the flavors, which brim with ripe raspberries, cherries and pomegranates, accented with toasty, spicy oak. Drink now–2017.",90
Kerin O’Keefe,San Lorenzo 2009 Bramante  (Brunello di Montalcino),"Dark berry and baking spice aromas emerge from the glass and carry over to the juicy palate together with fleshy wild cherry, plum, black pepper, cinnamon and vanilla alongside big round tannins. Well balanced with great length, this poised wine already is accessible, so drink 2015–2019.",90
Anne Krebiehl MW,Schloss Gobelsburg 2012 Lamm Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),"Yeasty aromas give way to a ripe, plump palate. Varietally typical phenolic richness is kept in check by acidity.",90
Anne Krebiehl MW,Schloss Gobelsburg 2012 Renner Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),"Juicy pear mingles into a savory, almost soy-spiced midpalate. Round and rich, it leads to a pleasantly bitter and ultra-clean finish.",90
Michael Schachner,TeHo 2011 Red Blend Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),"Licorice, cardamom, blueberry and cassis aromas are subtle but complementary. A firm, healthy feel isn't particularly hard or tannic, while candied berry and sweet oak flavors lead to a long, smooth finish. This blend of 67% Malbec and 33% Cab Sauvignon is ripe, ready and exemplifies Mendoza's penchant for big wines with balance. Only 150 cases made.",90
Kerin O’Keefe,Tenuta di Sesta 2009  Brunello di Montalcino,"Although the color is an evolved garnet with brick edges, this wine offers a fresh nose of blue flower, gingerbread and ripe cherry with hints of toast and clove. The palate is evolved but still delivers ripe red cherry, vanilla and espresso along with smoothed tannins and soft acidity. Not much complexity and even though it's forward, it's also balanced. Drink through 2019.",90
Kerin O’Keefe,Terre Nere 2009  Brunello di Montalcino,"Brawny and forward, it leads with alluring fragrances of blue flower, underbrush, forest berries, balsamic herbs and leather. The juicy palate delivers mature wild cherry layered with white pepper, cinnamon, thyme and mint. While already deliciously accessible, it should develop some complexity in the next few years but don't hold too long. Drink through 2019.",90
,Gigante 2010 Ribolla Gialla (Colli Orientali del Friuli),"Vintner Adriano Gigante delivers a thick, resiny Ribolla Gialla with aromas of candied fruit, caramel and apricot. Try this pretty wine with ravioli stuffed with yellow squash.",86
Susan Kostrzewa,Greek Wine Cellars 2010 Moscofilero Moschofilero (Mantinia),"White flowers and peach start this slightly simple but good white from Greece. On the palate, lemon and orange flavors join with a honeyed spice. The overall character is balanced and friendly.",86
,Bella Ragazza 2010 Pinot Grigio (California),"On the sugary side, with sweetened pineapple, green apple and peach flavors that are brightened with crisp acidity. If you like your white wines on the sweet side, this is a good price.",85
,Vinum 2010 White Elephant White (California),"Shows plenty of oak influence, wrapping around tropical fruit notes. It's richly textured if somewhat low in acid, giving it a weighty feel on the palate. Drink now.",85
,Castelfeder 2010 15er Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige),"There's a chalky, almost sweet element to the mouthfeel that recalls Pez candy or lemon soda. The fruit aromas are bright, intense and make up for the streamlined mouthfeel.",85
,Castelluccio 2009 Lunaria Sauvignon Blanc (Forlì),"Lunaria is a very interesting wine that represents one of the only attempts at making Sauvignon Blanc in the Forlì area of central Italy. Great for appetizers or easy vegetarian pasta dishes, it offers citrus, passion fruit and chopped sage aromas.",85
,Conte Ferdinando Guicciardini 2009 Massi di Mandorlaia Vermentino (Maremma),This crisp Vermentino would make a great companion to smoked salmon or swordfish carpaccio. The wine is bright and zesty with simple citrus and spice on the close.,85
Susan Kostrzewa,Estate Constantin Gofas 2008 Agiorgitiko (Nemea),"This wine has the plucky character typical of Greece, but with a polished spin. The nose is allspice, cherry and cocoa, and on the palate, dried fruits, coffee, mesquite smoke and chocolate. The wine finishes spicy and clean. Good, if not a bit aggressive. Pair with meat or hearty fare.",85
,Fongoli 2009 Grechetto (Colli Martani),"Here's an easy Grechetto from central Italy that offers sun-denched aromas of apricot, honeysuckle, white mineral and a touch of tangy, sweet spice. This native Italian grape pairs beautifully with white meat, fish or salad.",85
Michael Schachner,Kaiken 2010 Rosé of Malbec Rosé (Mendoza),"Generic on the nose, with undistinguished aromas of red fruits and candy. Feels plump and tastes a bit stalky, with generic red cherry, plum skin and candied flavors. Harmless and a touch sweet; drink well chilled.",85
Susan Kostrzewa,Lafazanis 2010 Electus Moschofilero (Mantinia),"This Moschofilero starts with honeyed peach, spice and lemon aromas, followed by a light touch of peach and minerals on the palate. Easy drinking and linear, this wine will pair well with cheese and light fare.",85
,Moretti Omero 2009 Nessuno White (Umbria),"Made with organically farmed fruit, this bright blend of Grechetto (80%) and Malvasia offers easy aromas of citrus, grapefruit and a touch of mature pineapple. The wine is fresh, lean and compact.",85
,Peter Franus 2010 Chardonnay (Carneros),"Shows the weakness of certain Napa Valley Chardonnays, with a dry herbaceous taste that accentuates the acidity and even the tannins. Although there are pineapple and oak flavors, the wine lacks interest.",85
,TerrAmore 2010 Pinot Grigio (Veneto),"Fresh, informal and fun (in a screwcap bottle), this organically farmed Pinot Grigio delivers bright aromas of cut grass, exotic fruit and citrus. It's an easy wine with a carefree attitude.",85
,Bogle 2010 Riesling (California),"You almost have to classify this Riesling as a dessert wine, because it crosses the line from off-dry into frankly sweet. It's an easy sipper, with honeyed tangerine and pear flavors. Could be a little brighter in acidity, though.",85
Susan Kostrzewa,Boutari 2010 Moschofilero (Mantinia),"Luscious aromas of ripe peach and citrus are followed by balanced waves of peach, lemon curd and melon on the palate. Soft in style and approachable, this is a good everyday white that drinks very well on its own or paired with poultry, salads.",85
,Carmel Road 2010 Pinot Noir (Monterey),"Shows ripe, grapey raspberry and cherry jam flavors, with a bite of citrusy acidity. A good Pinot Noir for drinking with roast salmon or a juicy hamburger.",85
,Carpineto 2010  Vernaccia di San Gimignano,"Carpineto consistently delivers clean, territory-driven wines at competitive prices. This lively Vernaccia opens with green apple, cut grass and dried sage aromas. It would pair nicely with a heaping plate of fried calamari rings.",85
Virginie Boone,Concannon 2009 Conservancy Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley),"A value-driven Cabernet to be sure and one, under the Conservancy mantra, that serves to raise funds to protect vineyard land from urban development. This vintage is full, with baked plum and earthy flavors, even-handed overall, with a hint of green bean on the finish.",85
Michael Schachner,DiamAndes 2010 Malbec (Uco Valley),"A heavy, dark and loud Malbec with bullish floral and black fruit aromas. Offers vise-grip tannins and borderline-overpowering blackberry flavors. Darkens on the finish, leaving espresso bitterness and chocolaty spice.",85
,J. Lohr 2010 Falcon's Perch Pinot Noir (Monterey County),"It's a proper Pinot Noir in the silky texture and cherry and cola flavors, which finish smooth and dry. Other than that, it's rustic and heavy.",85
Roger Voss,Laurenz V. 2010 Laurenz and Sophie Singing Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),"Rounded, ripe, this Grüner is finely balanced, with apple flavors and a citric edge. It has intense acidity with a creamy character, and is ready to drink now. Screwcap.",85
Paul Gregutt,LaVelle 2010 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),This quickly veers from being delicately light into simply sour and grassy. Cucumber- and tart melon-flavored fruit fades into a short finish.,85
,Merryvale 2009 Hyde Vineyard Chardonnay (Carneros),"The vineyard is a great one, but this Chardonnay tastes way too oaky. It's swamped by buttered toast, vanilla and butterscotch flavors that barely give the underlying pineapple and lemon fruits a chance to express themselves.",85
,Montresor 2010 Pinot Grigio (Valdadige),"Simple, clean and fresh, this no-fuss Pinot Grigio would pair nicely against Chinese take-out or an outdoor salad lunch. It shows clean aromas of citrus and white peach.",85
Lauren Buzzeo,Mullineux 2011 Kloof Street Chenin Blanc (Swartland),"There's a toasty streak that adds depth to the apple and melon fruit core of this wine. Soft tropical fruit accents appear in the mouth, with a brioche-flavored finish sealing the deal.",85
,Nals Margreid 2009 Müller-Thurgau (Alto Adige),This expression of Müller-Thurgau is thin and crisp in the mouth with lemon and candied fruit aromas on the nose. The aromas are flatter and less floral than you might expect from this fragrant grape variety.,85
Michael Schachner,Chaltén 2007 Reserva Pinot Noir (Neuquén),"Opens with aromas of tomato leaf, fresh salsa and rubber. Later on red fruit enters the picture, and on the palate there's adequate raspberry and plum with a hint of chocolate. Feelwise, it's a touch gummy. But overall this wine from Patagonia is solid and proves that Argentinean Pinot Noir has its merits.",85
Roger Voss,Drappier NV Carte d'Or Brut  (Champagne),"The main nonvintage Champagne from Drappier is open, fresh and very easy. The fruit shows pears and apricots, tightened up by some green apple skins. The general feel is softness. An enjoyable apéritif Champagne.",85
,Fernwood 2005 Estate Zinfandel (Santa Cruz Mountains),"This is a drily astringent Zinfandel with bracing acidity, and it's a little tough right now. But it has enough briary mountain berry fruit, clove and savory pepper flavors to work against barbecued meats and poultry.",85
,Hendry 2005 Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"Here's an oaky, ripe Chardonnay. It has pleasant pineapple, peach and lemon flavors and crisp acidity, and while it's not especially complex, it's a nice Chard for drinking now.",85
,Vino Sapien 2006 Thompson Vineyard Granddaddy Grenache (Santa Barbara County),"A little sweet and jammy, this Grenache has pie-filling flavors of cherries and raspberries, enriched with brown sugar, cinnamon, anise and cocoa. The richness is balanced with crisp acidity, but the wine is fundamentally simple and charming.",85
,La Fenêtre 2006 Santa Barbara Highlands Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Barbara County),"The winery continues to try to figure out how to grow Cabernet in this remote part of the county. Ripeness isn't the problem. Structure is. The flavors are upfront in blackberries, cherries and currants, but complexity and dryness remain challenges.",85
Paul Gregutt,Mercer 2007 Pinot Gris (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is quite crisp and clean, with fairly typical flavors for Washington Pinot Gris. Which is to say, not nearly as fleshy as the wines from Oregon, with less of the juicy pear character. There's plenty of acid, more like green apple than ripe pear. It's a soundly made wine, clean and fresh, but less varietally distinctive than one would hope for.",85
Paul Gregutt,Mercer 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is a good, every day effort, much like the baseline Ste. Michelle Sauvignon Blancs. Lightly grassy, lemony and tart, it is an all-purpose quaffer.",85
,Merryvale 2004 Silhouette Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"A beat or two off the pace of previous vintages, the '04 is a little soft and one-dimensional. Tastes like it was baked by the heat, with jammy white and yellow fruit flavors that have a trace of bitterness.",85
,Pietra Santa 2007 Amore Pinot Grigio (Cienega Valley),"A fine unoaked Pinot Grigio that shows the crispness, delicate body and richness you want in this variety. The citrus, honeysuckle and vanilla flavors could be drier, but lots of people will enjoy that edge of sugar.",85
,Prospero 2006 Petite Sirah (Sonoma County),"Has Petite Sirah's inky black color and strong, thick tannins, and is very dry, with blackberry flavors that could be a little more intense. Unless you like your red wines right out of the cradle, this one really needs cellaring through at least 2010.",85
,Robert Mondavi 2006 To Kalon Vineyard Reserve Fumé Blanc (Oakville),"Shows the beautiful acidity and dry crispness that this bottling invariably displays. But this cool, unbalanced vintage has taken its toll, with a green unripeness to the citrus fruit that even the winemaker admits was significantly cooler than average.",85
,Ortman Family 2005 Syrah (Paso Robles),"Black pepper dominates the aroma of this wine, along with black currants, grilled meat and something sweetly spicy and exotic, like a teriyaki dressing. In the mouth, it turns softly sweet and candied. Drink now.",85
Roger Voss,Mansard NV Premier Cru Brut  (Champagne),"Soft, light, frothy apéritif style, pleasantly balanced with pear flavors. The aftertaste is soft, but the balance remains. Attractive, uncomplicated.",85
,Mosby 2006 Dolcetto (Santa Barbara County),"Dry and delicately structured, this is a high-acid, fairly austere wine. The flavors of tobacco, tart cherry skins and pepper will seem insufficient to fans of fruit-driven wines, but give this Dolcetto the right Italian-inspired fare, and it will shine.",85
Paul Gregutt,Covey Run 2006 Quail Series Fumé Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Just a splash of Chenin Blanc has been added to the blend, adding some lift to the aromas and suggestions of citrus blossom. The natural herbaceousness of Sauvignon Blanc has been kept in check, but the wine is clean and varietal. The flavors seem just a bit muted, almost thin, but it's a perfectly refreshing, if simple effort.",85
,Foxen 2005 Range 30 West Red (Santa Ynez Valley),"A little tough and gritty, but with rich, forward flavors of berry and cherry jam, cocoa, clove and anise flavors. A Merlot-based Bordeaux blend.",85
,Ursa 2005 Petite Sirah (Sierra Foothills),"Very soft, with low acidity and a texture as creamy as pudding, this Petite Sirah is made for early drinking. It's frankly delicious, with blackberry, currant, cherry, raspberry, chocolate and pepper-spice flavors that flood the mouth with opulence.",85
,Wolff 2006 Petite Sirah (Edna Valley),"Edna Valley is a pretty chilly growing area, and you can taste the climate in the thick tannins and zingy acids that mark this Petite Sirah. It shows the variety's classic flavors of blackberries and currants, with notes of dried leather, tobacco, beefsteak and pepper.",85
,Zaca Mesa 2006 Grenache (Santa Ynez Valley),"A bit too brittle and tart to earn a higher score. Could be bottle shock, but it's hard to tell. Tasted in May, the wine showed mint-infused cherry flavors and turned sharp on the finish. Made from 100% Grenache.",85
,Handley 2005 Handley Vineyard Syrah (Dry Creek Valley),"My bottle was sulfury on opening, but it blew off quickly. Then the wine revealed itself as very soft and somewhat simple, although dry. It shows modest flavors of ripe crushed summer blackberries and pepper.",85
,Brander 2007 Merlot (Santa Ynez Valley),"A little green and minty, with sweet cherry, vanilla cream and smoke flavors brightened with crisp acidity. Drink now.",85
Roger Voss,Messias NV 20 Anos Tawny  (Port),"This is a sweet, soft Port, with plenty of fruit. Sultana and orange jelly flavors are cut with some spirit. The wine leans much more towards fruit than wood, unusual for a 20-year old. The wine, like all aged tawnies, is ready to drink.",87
Matt Kettmann,Pear Valley 2014 Pear Valley Vineyard Viognier (Paso Robles),"Orange, nectarine, canned pear and honeysuckle show on the nose of this quaffable bottling. The palate is nicely creamy but not overly thick, with banana cream and pear-mousse flavors that grow increasingly tropical as the sip lingers.",87
Kerin O’Keefe,Piccini 2011 Riserva  (Chianti Classico),"Subdued aromas of blackberry, grilled herb and a hint of menthol lead the way. The straightforward, easy-drinking palate offers mature black cherry, coffee and a hint of brown spice alongside soft, round tannins. Enjoy through 2017.",87
Roger Voss,Quinta do Crasto 2014 Crasto White (Douro),"This is fresh, fruity and with an attractive creamy texture. The crisp apple comes from the high-acid Rabigato grape that's softened by Viosinho and Gouveio. That makes for a balanced, light wine that is ready to drink.",87
Roger Voss,Quinta dos Avidagos 2014 Avidagos Red (Douro),"Towards the western end of the Douro vineyards, Avidagos is a fine place for table wines. This young, ripe and rounded wine is made to be drunk young. It has great black fruits and acidity that are linked by the firm tannin background. The wine will be ready from the end of 2016.",87
Michael Schachner,Quintay 2015 Q Grand Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),"Pungent aromas of wet stones, citrus fruits, grass and bell pepper are lively and intense. This has a crisp, clean palate and pyrazine-based flavors of nettle, bell pepper and lime. On the finish, it remains racy until the end.",87
Jim Gordon,Rickshaw 2014 Pinot Noir (California),"A smooth texture and ripe, inviting black cherry flavors make this medium-bodied wine easy to drink and enjoy. Light spicy accents give it extra interest and moderate tannins help build the suave mouthfeel.",87
Virginie Boone,Robert Mondavi 2014 Pinot Noir (Carneros),"This is a serviceable, soft and widely distributed wine, yeasty with aromas of baked bread circling concentrated red fruit and black tea. Light bodied and youthful, it holds on to oak and tannin on the finish.",87
Michael Schachner,Santa Ema 2015 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),"Some may find this coastal SB to be too green and vegetal, but that's cool-climate Leyda in a nutshell. Aromas of bell pepper and asparagus bring on the pyrazines, while in the mouth, this is spritzy and chunky. A reprise of green, pyrazine-driven flavors finish fresh but slightly bitter.",87
Paul Gregutt,Amity 2013 Pinot Blanc (Willamette Valley),"This pure varietal wine conjures up apple and pear juice, finished dry and crisply defined. There is no particular nuance to it, but it's well made and quite quaffable.",87
Kerin O’Keefe,Carpineto 2014  Chianti Classico,"Lively and straightforward, this opens with aromas of red berry, moist earth and a hint of chopped herb. The tart, easygoing palate offers juicy Marasca cherry and a dash of white pepper alongside zesty acidity.",87
Kerin O’Keefe,Casa Emma 2012 Vignalaparco  (Chianti Classico),"Aromas of grilled herb, French oak, scorched earth and menthol lead the nose. The juicy, accessible palate offers Morello cherry, vanilla, orange peel and a hint of mocha alongside fine-grained but rather fleeting tannins. Drink through 2017.",87
Roger Voss,Casa Santos Lima 2014 Bonavita Red (Lisboa),"A mixed bag of varieties went into this soft and fruity wine. It has gentle tannins that are lifted by acidity and black currant fruitiness. With its lifestyle label (a small Vespa motor scooter), it is obviously meant to be an easy-going ready-to-drink wine. And it succeeds.",87
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Castell 2014 Castell Trocken Silvaner (Franken),"Smoke and dusty minerals meld into tart, green gooseberry and lime flavors on the palate of this brisk, dry Silvaner. It's a fine-footed wine showing varietally characteristic notes of citrus and fresh herb. Spine tingling acidity leads a brisk finish.",87

Roger Voss,Domaine d'Escausses 2014 L'Ombre Fraîche White (Gaillac),"This comes from a complicated blend of Muscadelle, Loin de l'Oeil and Sauvignon Blanc: a touch from both the Mediterranean and the Atlantic.

Virginie Boone,Kunde 2013 Reserve Century Vines Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"Made from vines well over 100 years old on the Kunde Estate, this wine is tight and youthful in dry, dusty and grippy tannin, with thick, extracted flavors of red berry and cherry.

A fresh, solidly composed finish provides for a healthy conclusion.",87

Roger Voss,Quinta dos Aciprestes 2011 Tinto Red (Douro),"This is a hard, edgy and tannic wine that has a bitter edge overlaying the fruit. It seems tough, although there are hints of ripe berry fruits that are hiding away. Some softening over the next year will offer integration. Drink from 2016.",87
Kerin O’Keefe,Rainoldi 2010 Inferno Riserva  (Valtellina Superiore),"Aged in new barriques, this opens with aromas of oak and oak-driven spices and a whiff of savory herbs.

Virginie Boone,Verse & Chorus 2012 Mat Kearney Red (Napa Valley),"Milk chocolate and dark plum combine to nice effect in this majority-Merlot, blended with almost 25% Cabernet Sauvignon. Dry, savory and spicy in cinnamon and clove, the wine is substantially dense and thick on the palate.",87
Michael Schachner,Viña Casas Patronales 2012 Reserva Privada Carmenère (Maule Valley),"Concentrated scents of iodine, olive and herbal blackberry set up a loud palate supported by noticeable acidity.

Jim Gordon,Philo Ridge 2012 Firebrick Vineyard Zinfandel (Mendocino),"Full flavored and full bodied, this big, expansive wine oozes ripe and dried fruit character from the aroma to the flavors and finish. It suggests blackberry and strawberry flavors, feels tannic on the palate rather than soft, and carries a bit of warmth.",87
Mike DeSimone,Ixsir 2011 El Red (Lebanon),"Violet red to the eye, this wine is a blend of 55% Syrah, 35% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Merlot. A nose of black cherry and violet prepares the palate for flavors of cassis, cherry conserves, orange zest, licorice and tobacco.

Roger Voss,Jean-Marc Brocard 2013 Vau de Vey Premier Cru  (Chablis),"A ripe and rounded wine, this is touched by honey as well as rich yellow fruits, and is generous and full in the mouth.

With a grippiness on the finish, the wine offers velvety power and finesse.",91
Alexander Peartree,Lovingston 2012 Josie's Knoll Merlot (Monticello),"This is a well-done effort from winemaker Riaan Rossouw, which shows how engaging, inviting and refined Merlot can be. Spiced red plum and red currant aromas seductively waft over dried fern and Mediterranean herb tones. Silky, soft tannins provide just enough structure to uphold the curvacious body of ripe red plum, sweet baking spice and additional dried herbs.

Jim Gordon,Lynch Wines 2012 Strummer Syrah (Sierra Foothills),"Sweet oak perfume comes from 25% new French barrels.

Virginie Boone,MacLaren 2012 Atoosa's Vineyard Syrah (Russian River Valley),"The winery's coolest, lightest Syrah, this is an elegant, ethereal wine, sanguine and gamy with an abundance of white pepper and blueberry. Complex, it takes on a thick middle before finishing lean and soft.",91
Roger Voss,Magnum Vinhos 2014 Ribeiro Santo Encruzado (Dão),"Made from one of the great white grapes of Portugal (perhaps in the world), this rich wine, with its floral character, ripe yellow fruits and touches of wood and toast, is impressive and opulent.

Anna Lee C. Iijima,Friedrich Becker 2011 Becker Family Dry Pinot Noir (Pfalz),"Hints of smoke, cinnamon and vanilla lend added depth to this deeply brambly, berried Pinot Noir. It's rich and round on the palate, yet balanced foursquare by a strike of cranberry acidity and soft, feathery tannins. The finish is long and persistent.",91
Michael Schachner,Andeluna 2011 Pasionado Cabernet Franc (Tupungato),"A mix of cedary oak, rich berry fruit and spice aromas come together seamlessly on the nose of this ripe, chunky Cab Franc, something Andeluna has been working on for years and now has right. Rooty black-fruit flavors come with plenty of oak spice, chocolate and pepper notes, while the finish is long, spicy and comfortable. Drink through 2020.",91
Roger Voss,Anselmo Mendes 2014 Muros Antigos Alvarinho (Vinho Verde),"From the Vinho Verde subregion of Monção and Melgaço, this intense, bone-dry wine captures the richness of Alvarinho while not losing sight of its fresh lemon and crisp apple side. It has a tight texture that suggests the wine is still young, so drink from late 2016.",91
Roger Voss,Azamor 2010 Red (Alentejano),"Still firm in tannins, this has developed into an austere and dark wine. It is serious and solid, with a firm, brooding character and layers of acidity as well as black currant fruits. It is probably ready to drink now.",91
Anna Lee C. Iijima,Bernhard Huber 2011 Trocken Pinot Noir (Baden),"Earthy complexities of granite, bramble and balsamic vinegar lend contrast to this lusciously ripe Pinot Noir, full of black cherry and plum flavors.

Michael Schachner,Bodega Tacuil 2013 Viñas de Dávalos Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon (Salta),"Earthy, stewy aromas of baked berry and tree bark are typical for this winery. This blend of 80% Malbec and 20% Cabernet is dense, layered and shows just enough acidity to stay upright.

Jim Gordon,Boeger 2013 Estate Zinfandel (El Dorado),"A deep, dark color, ripe blackberry aromas and berry and spice flavors add up to a full-bodied, impressive wine from one of the oldest wineries in the Sierra Foothills.

Paul Gregutt,Quady North 2010 Vinum Pro Virtus Arsenal Cabernet Franc-Merlot (Applegate Valley),"This is a reserve-level blend of Cabernet Franc and Merlot, given extra bottle-age prior to release. If you favor more than a hint of stem and herb in your Bordeaux-style blends, you'll find this quite interesting. Complex layers of iron, smoke, coffee grounds and cassis are in play, with a slight bitterness to the tannins. Pair it up with lamb chops right off the grill.",91
Sean P. Sullivan,Rudius 2013 Stoney Vine Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),"This winery's Walla Walla Valley debut displays aromas of ash, green olive, grilled asparagus, dried flowers, smoked meat and blue fruit. The smoke and savory flavors are soft and reserved in style, showing a pleasing persistence on the finish.",91
Jim Gordon,Saxon Brown 2012 Durell Vineyard Hayfield Block Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"The dark garnet color seems right for a wine that smells like black cherries and black-skinned plums, and tastes deep and rich.

Paul Gregutt,Treos 2014 Albariño (Willamette Valley),"Albariño is rare enough in Oregon, but virtually unknown in the Willamette Valley. This estate-grown wine, from a vineyard in the valley's southwest corner, makes a solid case for more.

There's nothing simple about it; the flavors extend and expand through a wonderfully long finish.",91
Kerin O’Keefe,Pala 2014 Stellato  (Vermentino di Sardegna),"Heady aromas of yellow field flower, dried Mediterranean herb and a whiff of tropical fruit lead the nose. The juicy palate delivers ripe pear, peach, pineapple and wild fennel. Fresh acidity lifts up the creamy finish.",91
Roger Voss,Poeira 2014 Pó de Poeira White (Douro),"The second white wine of Poeira, this is all fruit. It has crisp acidity, citrus and green plum flavors along with a brilliant, steely texture. It is much too young to drink with its structure and tight character, so enjoy from late 2016.",91

Lauren Buzzeo,Ken Forrester 2010 Petit Pinotage (Western Cape),"Ken Forrester's Petit Pinotage is an accessible and easy-drinking wine from the notoriously love-it-or-hate-it grape that shows bright brambly forest berry and plum flesh flavors coupled with a touch of coffee-infused milk chocolate on the finish. Balanced and juicy, it's sure to please.",86
Lauren Buzzeo,MAN Vintners 2010 Chardonnay (Coastal Region),The notes of green apple and lemony citrus are fresh and clean with great clarity and precision. Balanced and easy to drink with a buttoned-up finish. Drink now.,86
Michael Schachner,Matsu 2008  Toro,"A big, burly wine that's loaded with power and fruit but is also tannic and drying. Tastes sort of raisiny and hot, with grating tannic scrub and fire in the hole. Pretty good but it doesn't have the purity, elegance and clean richness of the region's best wines.",86
Michael Schachner,Michel Torino 2009 Don David Finca La Maravilla #6 Malbec (Cafayate),"A bit grassy and green, with good power, herbal black fruit aromas, spice and cola. The palate is very high in acidity, which at first creates a sheering sharpness and tart plum flavors. With more airing it grows rounder and more complex, but overall it's exacting, odd and funky.",86
Paul Gregutt,Milbrandt 2008 The Estates Malbec (Wahluke Slope),"The grape's fruit flavors of blackberry and black cherry are nicely focused and rounded, but the vanilla and tobacco components, perhaps from aggressive oak treatment, bring in a bit of bitterness to the tannins. It's a fight to the finish—fruit or tannin—and too soon to pick a winner.",86
Virginie Boone,Morro Bay 2008 Split Oak Estates Cabernet Sauvignon (California),"A fine, soft-tannined Cab made from Lodi Rules grapes missing some body in the midpalate, but otherwise fair for the $12 price.",86
Virginie Boone,Naggiar 2009 Estate grown Viognier (Sierra Foothills),"This late-harvest Viognier looks like a still wine as it comes out of the bottle, exploding with honey and wildflowers on the nose. Its fruitiness is restrained somewhat and would stand out paired with a crème brûlée—though on its own, the alcohol is overpowering.",86
,Niner 2007 Bootjack Ranch Syrah (Paso Robles),"Defines a certain style of Paso Robles red wine, soft in structure, with easy, gentle tannins and ripe, pronounced fruit that's almost candied in sweetness. But in this case, the blackberry and cherry flavors are totally dry.",86
Paul Gregutt,Ott & Murphy 2008 Tempranillo (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Light strawberry fruit is matched to barrel notes of cola and caramel. There is more than a trace of barnyard and earth, and the tannins have a tea-like astringency. The fruit seems a bit over-matched.",86
Roger Voss,Quinta das Maias 2010 Branco White (Dão),"A blend of six varieties, this is a perfumed wine, with flavors of wood aging to go with the yellow fruits. and a soft, rounded mouthfeel.",86

,Red Truck 2009 Pink Truck Rosé (California),"Hard to say if this is a dessert wine or a rosé, because it's fairly sweet. Let's call it a rosé. And a pretty one it is, with savory orange, raspberry and vanilla flavors, balanced with acidity.",86
,Rock Wall 2009 Monte Rosso Vineyard Reserve Zinfandel (Sonoma County),"Hot and scoury in high alcohol, and that burn is accented by Zin's powerhouse tingly spices. The flavors are extracted and sweet in raspberries, cherries and milk chocolate. Enjoy this rugged Zin with barbecue and roasts.",86
Joe Czerwinski,Bulletin Place 2009 Shiraz (South Eastern Australia),"This value-priced label has turned out a notably successful 2009 Shiraz, combining red currants with enough meaty, savory elements to possess real interest. It's medium in body and fleshy yet crisp, making it very drinkable over the near term.",86
Michael Schachner,Tercos 2010 Malbec (Mendoza),"Woodsy, spicy aromas form a solid opening. There's adequate acidity on the palate along with raspberry, red plum and mild herbal notes. Racy, spicy and just toasty enough to rate well across the finish.",86
Virginie Boone,Tortoise Creek 2008 Cherokee Lane Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi),"Name checking an old stretch of Lodi highway, this Cab has more red cherry fruit than black as well as a noticeable trace of cedar, lacking in structure and acidity perhaps but decent enough—and very fairly priced—to pop open with a midweek steak. The grapes used are Lodi Rules certified green sustainable.",86
Paul Gregutt,Trust 2008 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"A cooler vintage in the Columbia Valley, which perhaps contributes to a wine that seems rather hard and thin. Though the alcohol is listed at 14.2%, the fruit is tight and one dimensional, with dominant acidity. The wine is sound and balanced, but not showing its best at the moment.",86
,Vecchia Cantina di Montepulciano 2008 Poggio Stella Merlot (Cortona),"This easy Poggio Stella Merlot is redolent of black cherry, mature raspberry and currants. It's aged in oak casks for six months to add a playful touch of spice and toast. Pair this well-priced Italian wine with grilled sausage or meatloaf.",86

,Barefoot Bubbly NV Moscato Spumante Champagne Sparkling (California),"A sweet style of sparkling wine, with brisk acidity framing orange, lime, vanilla and honey flavors. Nice with wedding cake, at a good price.",86
Roger Voss,Chateau de Launay 2005 Les Vignes de Julia  (Bordeaux Supérieur),"With a few years in bottle, this is maturing well. It has ripeness, the tannins beginning to soften into rich spice and damson jelly flavors. The acidity is still very present as is the dry core.",86
,Cobblestone 2006 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This soft, sweet, oaky Cabernet will appeal to those who like the New World style. It's as puffy as a dessert concoction, with cherry, chocolate, nougat and cinnamon spice flavors, and is ready to drink now.",86
,Dancing Derby 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (California),"A good, off-dry useful wine for drinking across the board with a wide variety of fare, or by itself as a cocktail. It's brisk and clean, with pleasant citrus, apricot, spice and vanilla flavors.",86
,De Loach 2009 Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"A solid Zin for everyday drinking. A little rough and thin, but dry and spicy, with berry, currant and teriaki flavors.",86
Michael Schachner,Dominio de Eguren 2010 Protocolo Blanco White (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),"Melon and almond skin aromas lead to pithy citrus on what amounts to a pretty good bouquet. Round, citrusy and fresh in the mouth, with orange, passion fruit and tropical leanings. Solid and well shaped for a $7 quaffer. 70% Airen and 30% Macabeo.",86
Michael Schachner,El Escocés Volante 2009 La Multa Old Vine Garnacha (Calatayud),"Mint and milk chocolate are the lead aromas, followed by cherry and herbal notes. The wine is basic, fresh and fruity, with choppy tannins, heat and lively red berry flavors with citrus undertones. Runs a bit rough and heady.",86
Roger Voss,Domaine Roblin 2010 Ammonites  (Sancerre),"With three years' aging, this has developed into an almond- and toast-flavored wine that has softened and rounded the fruit. It has turned into a serious wine, its rich structure allied to the acidity. Ready to drink.",90
,Écluse 2010 Ensemble Lock Vineyard Red (Paso Robles),"This is one of the best Bordeaux blends now available from Paso Robles. Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, it's enormously ripe in blackberry jam, currant, chocolate and cedar flavors that finish lush and spicy. The tannins are strong, but negotiable with barbecue.",90
Michael Schachner,Finca Constancia 2010 Syrah-Petit Verdot (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),"Right away you know this Syrah-Petit Verdot is a powerful wine. The bouquet is pointed and blasts away with cherry, berry, spice and oak aromas. It's thick, pushy and full-bodied, with minty, toasty oak flavors running side by side with blackberry. On the finish, it's more charred and toasty, with peppery spice and some heat. Drink now–2015.",90
,Bump 2011 Chardonnay (Sonoma Valley),"Sommeliers will appreciate this Chardonnay for its dryness and elegance, not to mention the price. It favors restraint over flamboyance, yet offers plenty of rich tropical and citrus fruits, with hints of honey and minerals. The alcohol is refreshingly balanced.",90
,Cantina Cortaccia 2009 Brenntal Riserva Gewürztraminer (Alto Adige),"Here's a gorgeous wine to pair with foie gras or pâté. A Riserva expression of Gewürztraminer, it opens with a bright golden color and segues to intense aromas of honey, candied peach, yellow rose, lemon curd and natural rubber. In the mouth, the wine is rich, opulent and long-lasting.",90
,Cantina Produttori Bolzano S. Maddalena/Gries 2011 Dellago Pinot Bianco (Alto Adige),Here is a beautiful Pinot Bianco with aromas of melon and stone fruit that pop right out of the glass. This white variety is generally known for the richness of its mouthfeel more than its bouquet. But this expression excels on both the nose and in the mouth thanks to its intensity and purity.,90
Roger Voss,Château de la Roulerie 2011 Les Terrasses Chenin Blanc (Anjou),"Powerful and rich, this is a concentrated, wood-aged wine. It has toasted almonds as well as ripe pear and green-plum fruit. With a fine tension under the fruitiness, it will age over several years.",90
Roger Voss,Château la Varière 2010 Cabernet Franc-Cabernet Sauvignon (Anjou Villages Brissac),"Full-bodied, fruity wine that has wood aging flavors along with red plum and strawberry fruits. Smoky, perfumed, this is a wine that shows fresh fruit with a good depth of flavor. Age for 2–3 years.",90
,ZD 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A finely crafted, complex Cabernet that shows classic Napa construction. The tannins are very fine and the acidity balancing, while the flavors are rich in black currants, minerals and cedar. Drink now–2017.",90
,Joseph Phelps 2010 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This wine shows the glamour you expect from a Phelps Cabernet. It's softly tannic and rich in blackberries, currants, licorice and cedar, with a lovely structure. Nice to drink now, right out of the bottle. Easy to find, with 17,300 cases produced.",90
Michael Schachner,Lafou 2011 Els Ameliers Garnacha Blanca (Terra Alta),"This is a really good showing for the Garnacha Blanca grape. The bouquet is fresh and not the least bit blowsy, with an emphasis on apple and pear aromas. The wine is plump, fruity and showing modest acidity, while flavors of apple and baking spices precede a finish that's easygoing. Drink now.",90
Michael Schachner,Monteviejo 2008 Lindaflor Malbec (Mendoza),"As a whole, this is top-shelf Malbec with weight, character and complexities. It's also a touch gamy on the nose, with a no-miss blast of compost. Beyond that, the palate shows lemony oak and tight tannins on top of oaky, leathery flavors of robust berry and baked plum. Drink this rock-solid specimen now through 2016.",90
Roger Voss,Patient Cottat 2010 Anciennes Vignes  (Sancerre),"Ripe black currant aromas set this wine on its full, warm path. It is intensely fruity with a rounded feel to it. The acidity cuts through the ripe character, giving tension and a piercing crisp aftertaste.",90
Roger Voss,Domaine l'Ancienne Cure 2011 Sélection Jour de Fruit  (Pécharmant),"Pécharmant produces some of the most dense reds of Bergerac, and this wine from Ancienne Cure shows some of the same character in a more fruity version. Black fruits and firm tannins are layered with forward acidity to give a wine that will be approachable this year.",90
Roger Voss,Domaine Seguin 2011  Pouilly-Fumé,"Initially youthfully crisp and herbaceous, the wine then broadens into riper more yellow-fruit flavors. That gives it richness and weight that balance with the grapefruit and lemon-juice freshness. Give this fine wine a year to meld together",90
,Domenico Cavazza 2009 Cicogna Syrah (Veneto),"You don't see much Syrah from the Veneto in northeast Italy, but Cicogna shows that the variety does have a future here. This expression is soft and plump with ripe fruit, blackberry, leather and tobacco. There's a point of bright freshness on the long finish.",90
Michael Schachner,San Pedro 2012 1865 Single Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),"Over the past few years, San Pedro has consistently put out excellent SBs under its 1865 label. This sings of coastal Chilean Sauvignon via mineral, passion fruit and grapefruit aromas. In the mouth, it's chiseled like a statue, with a mix of citrus and green flavors. Expect a cutting, crisp, zesty finish.",90
Virginie Boone,Sean Thackrey 2010 Cassiopeia Wentzel Vineyard Clone 777 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"With a depth of ripe cherry flavor, Sean Thackrey's Wentzel Clone 777, shows concentration and weight, with a riper, fleshier and bolder character than its clonal companions grown in the same vineyard block.",90
,Tolosa 2011 Pure Chardonnay (Edna Valley),"Tolosa may be the only vineyard to produce two unoaked Chardonnays in the same vintage. Their '11 Central Coast is quite good. This one, from estate Edna Valley fruit, is even better. With keen acidity and a brisk minerality, it shows complex flavors of limes, kiwis and grapefruits, and hints of riper, richer tropical fruits.",90
,Transcendence 2010 La Paloma Larner Vineyard Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),"A fancy Syrah, dry, complex and interesting to drink. It packs in a lot of blackberry and cherry fruit flavors, accented with a sweet jacket of smoky oak. The alcohol is a bit high, resulting in some heat. Drink soon.",90
,Alysian 2010 Floodgate Vineyard Rock Hill Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Ripe, forward flavors of raspberries, cherries and cola mark this Pinot Noir. It's gentle in the mouth and nice and low in alcohol. Seems too soft for aging, so drink over the next 2–3 years with a great steak.",89
Joe Czerwinski,Grafen Neipperg 2006 Neipperger Schlossberg Auslese Traminer (Württemberg),"Shows good varietal character in a somewhat sweet format. It starts off slightly musky and gingery on the nose, then adds lychee fruit flavors. For its sweetness, it's not particularly richly textured or weighty, making it a possibility as an apéritif.",88
Paul Gregutt,Bonair 2007 Dry Gewürztraminer (Yakima Valley),"This unusual dry Gewürztraminer puts the flavor focus squarely on grapefruit and pineapple, with a bone-dry acid underpinning. It has moderate concentration and length, with alcohol rated at just 12.5%.",88
,Calatrasi 2005 Accademia del Sole Shiraz (Sicilia),"Thick and brawny, this Sicilian Shiraz boasts a deep purple hue and presents in-your-face aromas of prune, cedar, blueberry and white peppercorn. The consistency is chunky and chewy, like play dough, but drying mineral tones help cap those jammy fruit flavors.",88
,Cantele 2006 Amativo Red (Salento),"Thick and luscious with deep oak tones and big cherry fruit flavors, this southern Italian red is a real fruit bomb with plush cherry intensity and ripe berry flavors. The strong sunshine has done its part to shape a thick, succulent red wine.",88
Roger Voss,Château de Fonbel 2006  Saint-Émilion,"Fresh black currant fruit gives this wine all the vivacity of the 2006 vintage. It is a beautiful, elegantly crafted wine, as you would expect from the same team as Château Ausone, and it has a lovely lightness of touch, with its final note one of delicious juiciness.",88
Roger Voss,Château Fonréaud 2006  Listrac-Médoc,"A wood-dominated wine that shows spice and high toast characters. It has probably seen too much wood in its aging, but there is fruit there, its black currant ripeness hiding in the background. Hopefully, the wood will soften and integrate.",88
Lauren Buzzeo,Château Maris 2005 Old Vine Syrah (Minervois La Liviniere),"A touch funky and green at first, that soon blows off to reveal a dark and wonderfully concentrated wine that shows some serious promise with age. Cassis, plum, black cherry, spice and tobacco fill the palate, with a long, smoky finish sealing the deal. Drink after 2010. Imported by The Portfolio Group.",88
,Colli di Lapio 2005 Donna Chiara Campi Taurasini Aglianico (Irpinia),"This is a very attractive wine with bursting cherry notes and vibrant layers of sweet spice and clove. You'll also get root beer, chopped herbs, tobacco and leather: the wine is thick and firm with oak-driven flavors.",88
Lauren Buzzeo,Domaine Lignères 2003 La Baronne Red (Corbières),"Moderately intense menthol, black licorice and African violets aromas on the nose. The mouth, full of ripe plum and dark cherries accented by notes of cocoa and fresh mint leaves, has a lovely balance and silky texture. Ends on a somewhat simple yet clean finish.",88
Joe Czerwinski,Drylands 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"Archetypal Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc, featuring pungent, herbal aromas to go alongside bold passion fruit notes. It shows ample weight in the mouth, even a slightly oily texture and pronounced green flavors that persist a good long time. Probably best with fresh tomato or strongly herbal dishes.",88
Michael Schachner,Elki 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Elqui Valley),"Pleasant and melony on the nose, without the sharp, piercing aromas that sometimes push Chilean SB over the edge. New from the north of Chile, Elki is medium-bodied and generous, but not too angular. It's a whole wine with common citrus flavors as opposed to something demanding and sharp.Drink right away.",88
,Prager 2004 Madeline Riesling (Napa Valley),"Honey-sweet and direct, with citrus jam, apricot essence, crème brûlée and vanilla cream flavors. Fine with white cookies, lemon chiffon pie, pineapple sorbet.",88
Susan Kostrzewa,Rietvallei Estate Wine 2007 Juanita Rosé Cabernet Sauvignon (Robertson),"Fresh, fruity and charming, this rosé offers full-bodied flavors of strawberry and spice that are balanced and complex. A step above the typical flirty rosé, the wine gives style and substance and will handle heartier dishes—think Moroccan tagine or grilled, spiced fish.",88
,Salvatore Molettieri 2006 Cinque Querce Aglianico (Irpinia),"This is a pleasantly intense wine with resiny aromas of tar, tobacco and smoked cedar wood. It has a dense, impenetrable personality and there are slightly bitter tannins on the close.",88
,Santa Maria 2004 Torre Pieve Chardonnay (Veneto),"Torre Pieve is a thick and creamy Chardonnay that is half aged in oak and half in stainless steel. These two methods give the wine structure and softness, but they also allow for the wine's natural fragrances to stay intact.",88
Joe Czerwinski,Shaw and Smith 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Adelaide Hills),"Shaw and Smith's Sauvignon Blanc has become emblematic of the Adelaide Hills style, combining tropical fruit with a grassy streak, all framed by zippy citrus flavors. This would work equally as an apéritif or with various seafood dishes.",88
,Talley 2006 Rosemary's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley),"The '06 had a hard act to follow after the classic 2005. It's not as great a Pinot Noir, showing a tannic brittleness and heaviness despite a rich undertow of red currants, mocha and spices. As good as it is, it lacks a refined elegance, and its hope lies in the cellar.",88
,Tedeschi 2005 Capitel San Rocco Red (Rosso del Veronese),"Tedeschi's Ripasso offers unique aromas that recall forest berry, bramble, green spice and crushed bay leaf. It's a succulent and slightly sweet tasting wine with bursting fruit flavors and thick, chewy density.",88
Joe Czerwinski,Mud House 2007 Swan Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"Sweaty and pungent, loaded with overtones of crushed tomato leaf, this is an assertively herbal wine that requires careful food pairing, or a healthy preference for that style. It's not terribly weighty, but shows nice leafy complexity and a hint of curranty fruit. Try it with mussels steamed with lots of fresh herbs.",88
,Fattoria Alois 2006 Cunto Pallagrello (Campania),Here's a well-toasted red wine from Southern Italy that sees eight months of oak for added aromas of spice and tobacco. It has a sophisticated edge and loads of fresh fruit nuances at the core.,88
,Florio NV Fine Sweet  (Marsala),"Candied fruit and caramel ride on the back of maple syrup, allspice and ground ginger. Marsala is for much more than cooking and you can try this wine with aged cheese or as an after-dinner drink.",88
,Vice Versa 2005 Le Petit Vice Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah (Sonoma-Napa),"This Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah blend is soft and ready to drink now. It's also very delicious, almost like a dessert pastry, with ultra-ripe black cherry, cassis, anise liqueur, melted milk chocolate and vanilla flavors that finish spicy-sweet.",88
Michael Schachner,Viña Mar de Casablanca 2008 Reserva Especial Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),"Pungent, zesty and quite varietal in its expression. The nose is racy and intense, with nettle, sweat and passion fruit aromas. Expect a wet, almost spritzy palate with green-edged fruit flavors and light herbaceousness. There's bite and sass to this one, and the finish is quite long.",88
